Today on <em>The Doctor\u2019s Farmacy<\/em>, I\u2019m excited to dig into all this and so much more, with Marcia Chatelain.<\/p>\n<p>A third of Americans eat fast food every day, and we know that fast food restaurants are hyper-concentrated in lower socioeconomic areas. It\u2019s no coincidence that African Americans consume more fast food than any other population and also have greater risks for obesity and diabetes.<\/p>\n<p>Marcia walks us through the history of fast food franchises in America and how they\u2019ve specifically impacted Black communities. This relationship rose from the notion of improved economic opportunity through entrepreneurship, but the idea backfired and has worked against these communities in myriad ways, which includes increased rates of chronic disease.<\/p>\n<p>Our social policies need to acknowledge that nutrition does indeed impact health outcomes and we need to improve access and education for healthy food to higher-risk populations. Marcia and I discuss the true cost of food and what shifts she believes are needed to change the trajectory of poor health for Black communities.<\/p>\n<p>While it might seem like an impossibly large topic to tackle, Marcia and I are hopeful. She shares that the intersection of COVID and the Great Resignation could be an incredible moment for raising awareness of the human toll of the food system. We\u2019re seeing people fight for justice in ways we\u2019ve never even thought of before.<\/p>\n<p>We also talk about the power of working in community to solve collective problems and thinking of how to get the same things for your neighbors that you\u2019d want for yourself.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/embed.acast.com\/5aecaca3a15c2dd12887881a\/62018fbca362ba0012984b38\" width=\"100%\" height=\"190px\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This episode is brought to you by Rupa Health, BiOptimizers, and Vuori.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rupa Health is a place where Functional Medicine practitioners can access more than 2,000 specialty lab tests from over 20 labs like DUTCH, Vibrant America, Genova, and Great Plains.
