If you\u2019re not quite sure what it is, why it could be beneficial, or you\u2019re well-acquainted with it and just want to learn more, this episode is for you.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ketogenic diet, or keto as it\u2019s called, is a high-fat low carbohydrate diet. While some people take this to mean loads of conventionally raised meat and dairy, the true (and beneficial version) means lots of beneficial fats from things like avocados, nuts and seeds, and coconut; high-quality protein from clean sources like grass-fed meat and pasture-raised eggs; and plenty of non-starchy vegetables.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To hash out more of the details about keto and how it can support good health, I was excited to talk with my friend and one of the leading voices in the Paleo\/Primal and keto movements, Mark Sisson. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mark and I kick off our conversation talking about his own experience tinkering with diet and lifestyle to achieve optimal health. As an endurance runner, he thought he was feeding his body right by carb-loading and leaning on whole grains; he realized fat was a missing piece and turned around some chronic health issues like IBS in the process. At 65, he looks like he\u2019s in his 30\u2019s, so I think we could all learn a thing or two from his journey.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re worried trying keto means never touching another carb, you\u2019ll be relieved to hear otherwise. Mark talks about the important concept of metabolic flexibility and how when we focus on primarily burning fat the body can better handle the sugar from carbohydrates during those occasions. We also debunk that myth that you can eat as many calories as you\u2019d like when you go keto, and why you wouldn\u2019t want to anyway.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being in our 60\u2019s, Mark and I are both adamant about healthy aging. We discuss how keto can support that, why weightlifting and muscle mass are so essential for staying fit and strong as you age, and the benefits of balanced blood sugar for longevity.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keto or not, there\u2019s so much great information about eating for optimal health in this episode. I hope you\u2019ll tune in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get Mark\u2019s latest book <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keto for Life<\/span><\/i> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">at<\/span> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ketoreset.com\/forlife\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">http:\/\/www.ketoreset.com\/forlife\/<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This episode is sponsored by Joovv, chili, and my Sleep Master Class.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I recently discovered Joovv, a red light therapy device.
