In fact, it\u2019s estimated that about 75 percent of the food in our supermarkets contains genetically modified ingredients. The promise of GMO foods held lots of promise\u2014they would produce high yields, solve our world hunger problems, and be insect resistant, thereby decreasing our dependence on toxic pesticides. But did GMOs live up to their promise? Dr. Hyman explored these topics in his interview with Ocean Robbins.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ocean Robbins is the author of 31-Day Food Revolution: Heal Your Body, Feel Great, &amp; Transform Your World. He serves as CEO and cofounder of the Food Revolution Network\u2014one of the largest communities of healthy eating advocates on the planet, with more than 500,000 members. Ocean comes from a long line of food-lovers, though they didn\u2019t all necessarily fit the same bill. His grandfather and great-uncle founded Baskin Robbins and his father walked away from the family fortune to pursue a career that promoted a cleaner and more nourishing diet. Ocean continues the legacy his father started by encouraging people to vote with their fork and think of the impacts our food choices have on the environment, socioeconomics, and of course health.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This episode is brought to you by Betterhelp.
