These pathways become faulty or interrupted with all of our modern inputs including the Standard American Diet, stress, lack of exercise, and lack of nutrients.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ever since I turned 60, I\u2019ve become fascinated with improving my protective pathways and boosting my mitochondria or energy factories. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitochondria are key energy sources for our bodies. They are tiny factories housed within our cells that take the foods we eat and the oxygen we breathe and convert them into energy. That energy is called adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, and it is used to support every function in our bodies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Poor functioning mitochondria lead to oxidative stress.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oxidation is the rust on our cars, the brown color that appears on an apple when cut and exposed to air, the rancid vegetable oil in our cupboards, even the wrinkles that form on our skin. What most of us don\u2019t realize is that our own tissues are rusting, our own fats are going rancid, and our brains are melting as we go about our daily lives.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What starts this process is some sort of insult\u2014things like too many calories, smoking, a sunburn, exposure to toxins, anti-nutrients, and sugar. The insult leads to injury by tipping the balance and starting a chain reaction of damage to cells and tissues, which leads us down the path to weight gain and chronic illness.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When mitochondria aren\u2019t working properly, metabolism runs less efficiently and can even shut down. This can lead to low energy, fatigue, memory loss, pain, rapid aging, and more.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitophagy, which is the recycling of mitochondria through a process called autophagy, helps to sweep away poor mitochondria.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Recycling our cellular powerhouses and sloughing off poorly functioning mitochondria is essential for anti-aging.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One compound that has been studied for its ability to induce mitophagy and scavenge free radicals (thereby preventing oxidation) is a compound called Urolithin A. Through a process involving our gut bacteria, ellagitannins (a type of polyphenol) are transformed into this super powerful compound, Urolithin A. You can find ellagitannins in foods like pomegranates, raspberries, and strawberries; however, less than half of people are able to metabolize ellagitannins into the active compound Urolithin A. The good news is that scientists have <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pioneered a way for everyone to benefit from the active pure form of Urolithin A, and it\u2019s called Mitopure.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.timelinenutrition.com\/science\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitopure has been clinically proven to revitalize the energy sources inside of our cells and our muscles, the mitochondria, and boost muscle strength.<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-37338 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Screen-Shot-2020-11-13-at-11.08.26-AM-812x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"807\" srcset=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Screen-Shot-2020-11-13-at-11.08.26-AM-812x1024.jpg 812w, https:\/\/drhyman.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Screen-Shot-2020-11-13-at-11.08.26-AM-238x300.jpg 238w, https:\/\/drhyman.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Screen-Shot-2020-11-13-at-11.08.26-AM-768x969.jpg 768w, https:\/\/drhyman.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/Screen-Shot-2020-11-13-at-11.08.26-AM.jpg 926w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a scientific breakthrough.
