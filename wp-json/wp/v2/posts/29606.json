My guest on this week\u2019s episode of <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/the-doctors-farmacy-with-mark-hyman-m-d\/id1382804627?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>The Doctor\u2019s Farmacy<\/em><\/a>, Dr. Oz, has changed the way that we approach our health, and he\u2019s made wellness more accessible than ever.<\/p>\n<p>What most people don\u2019t know about Dr. Oz is that he is a practicing physician. He still shows up to a hospital every week to do a job in addition to running his show, fighting for internet transparency, and running his nonprofit, HealthCorps.<\/p>\n<p>On this episode, Dr. Oz sets the record straight on his name and brand. Although many people believe that Dr. Oz is selling supplements, skincare items, and more, you might be surprised to learn that Dr. Oz doesn\u2019t actually have his name attached to any products. So why has his name become synonymous with advertising? Because of internet marketing laws. Dr. Oz explains how the lack of transparency around internet marketing has made it easy for people to use his name without his consent. I\u2019ve had a small taste of this myself in the past.<\/p>\n<p>In this episode, Dr. Oz also talks about his work with HealthCorps and their mission to change the lives of teens across America through in-school mentorship programs and much more.<\/p>\n<p>And finally, we talk about Dr. Oz\u2019s daily routine to manage his energy including prioritizing sleep (including naps!), and the importance of kindness, consciousness, service, and family.<\/p>\n<p>You won\u2019t want to miss this intimate conversation with America\u2019s teacher.
