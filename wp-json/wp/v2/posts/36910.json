Among its many functions, vitamin D reduces cellular growth (which promotes cancer) and improves cell differentiation (which puts cells into an anti-cancer state). But what\u2019s even more fascinating is how vitamin D regulates and controls genes. When we don\u2019t get enough it impacts every area of our biology, because it affects the way our cells and genes function.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your body makes vitamin D when it\u2019s exposed to sunlight. The problem is that most of us aren\u2019t exposed to enough sunlight or eating enough of the few natural dietary sources of vitamin D. The good news is that supplementing with vitamin D3 can be an effective way to reverse a vitamin D deficiency. However, it is important to test your vitamin D levels to assess your personalized needs before starting any supplementation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Hyman recently spoke to this topic in his conversations with Max Lugavere and Dr. Elizabeth Boham.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Max Lugavere is a filmmaker, health, and science journalist and the author of the <em>New York Times<\/em> bestselling book <em>Genius Foods: Become Smarter, Happier, and More Productive While Protecting Your Brain for Life<\/em>.
