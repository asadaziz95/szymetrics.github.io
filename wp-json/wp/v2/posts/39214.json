Most doctors and patients don\u2019t realize the connection, so they focus on treating the symptoms. Few know that the real solution lies in identifying the root cause. And the root cause is often the same for these two health crises. The culprit? The industrial American diet.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I\u2019ve treated patients for a multitude of physical conditions over the years, I saw that changes in their diet also resolved behavioral, mood, memory, or attention problems.\u00a0 I wrote about it several years ago in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/store.drhyman.com\/programs\/ultramind-solution-book-fix-your-broken-brain-by-healing-your-body-first-paperback.html\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The UltraMind Solution<\/span><\/i><\/a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and most recently in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/foodfixbook.com\/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Food Fix<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, an expos\u00e9 on the food industry.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The harmful effects of our nutritionally toxic and depleted food environment are widespread. Children struggle with intellectual development, ADHD, and behavioral problems. More and more adults suffer from panic attacks, crippling depression, cognitive decline, and chronic disease. And prisons are overflowing with criminals. Our national security is even at risk as many young adults are not fit to fight or eligible for service because of their mental or physical health. Overall diet quality, high sugar loads, and rampant nutritional deficiencies (including omega-3 fats, zinc, magnesium, vitamin D, and B vitamins) all drive behavior problems and mental health issues. It\u2019s an injustice we cannot ignore. And you won\u2019t when you realize how extensive the damage is.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><b>The achievement gap<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mental health issues are starting earlier and earlier. One in six children has a neurodevelopmental disorder. More than <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/ncbddd\/adhd\/data.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one in ten children have ADHD<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Depression, learning disabilities, and behavioral problems are rampant in schools. School nurses have to contend with boxes of prescription medications they have to dole out to kids during the school day. It\u2019s common to hear Americans lament our low global standing in academic performance. <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/factsmaps.com\/pisa-worldwide-ranking-average-score-of-math-science-reading\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are thirty-first<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in math, reading, and science in the world.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This phenomenon of poor school performance in kids with health issues, poor diets, obesity and diabetes, is called the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/cepa.stanford.edu\/sites\/default\/files\/reardon%20whither%20opportunity%20-%20chapter%205.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">achievement gap<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Lack of fresh fruits and vegetables and vitamin and mineral deficiencies lead to the same problems. How can we expect kids to learn and function when they are hungry, skip breakfast, or go to school with a bottle of soda and a bag of chips? The state of nutrition in most schools doesn\u2019t help\u2014cafeterias peddle the food industry\u2019s biggest brands of junk food for lunch and snacks. The result, according to the journal <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/pediatrics.aappublications.org\/content\/101\/1\/e3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pediatrics<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is that kids are inattentive, disruptive, late, or absent.

Kids literally bounce off the walls. Ever been to a birthday party where chaos ensues in the aftermath of a sugar binge? We are literally destroying the intellectual capital of our youth, with broad consequences for our whole society. In fact, we are raising the first generation of Americans who will live sicker and die younger than their parents.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only that, but special education costs are also skyrocketing across the country. In <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.asumag.com\/funding\/special-education-costs-weigh-down-san-diego-area-districts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">San Diego<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the costs for special education are $1 billion of a $5 billion overall school budget. The number of kids needing special education has grown 19 percent since 2012, while overall school enrollment has grown by 2 percent.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While multiple causes play a role, the majority of cognitive dysfunction in kids can be linked to poor nutrition. Iron deficiency is common, leading to lower dopamine function and impaired concentration. Vitamin and mineral deficiencies including B vitamins, iodine, zinc, and vitamin E are linked to worse cognitive abilities and poor concentration.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><b>Violence &amp; crime<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Science proves that food affects our hormones, brain chemistry, nutrient status, and other chemical and biological functions. In other words, what we eat changes our thinking, mood, and behavior. So it\u2019s no wonder food has been linked to mental health and violence. Consider the following research:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S0899900714002068\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junk food makes kids act violently<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014bullying, fighting\u2014and suffer more psychiatric distress, including worry, depression, confusion, insomnia, anxiety, aggression, and feelings of worthlessness.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In one study <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/114\/25\/6510\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cImpact of Nutrition on Social Decision Making,\u201d<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> scientists fed two groups different breakfasts.

The high-carb group was more likely to engage in \u201csocial punishment\u201d behavior such as negative comments and actions toward others in structured behavioral experiments. Now, consider that most Americans eat dessert for breakfast, full of sugar and carbs\u2014cereal, muffins, bagels, sugared coffees, pancakes, French toast, oatmeal\u2014this does not make for a very nice society.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Those who consume high levels of refined oils (currently more than 10 percent of our diet and found in all ultraprocessed foods) and low levels of omega-3 fats from fish have <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1177\/026010600701900204\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">higher rates of depression, suicide, and homicide<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

The federal government, states, and cities that maintain jails or prisons can sign contracts with food service providers that have health in mind and on the menu. Some prisons such as the Michigan Department of Corrections and the Richard J. Donovan correctional Facility (San Diego) have already started programs that use local farms to provide healthier meals. <\/span>\u00a0It\u2019s a no-brainer that health care should start paying for a food-as-medicine approach and programs to treat mental illness.
