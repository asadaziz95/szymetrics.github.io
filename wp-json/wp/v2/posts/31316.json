Hashimoto\u2019s is the leading cause of hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid) in the US and roughly 14 million people in the US are struggling with this diagnosis, with women at much higher risk, being 7 to 8 times more likely than men to get it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m willing to bet you know someone dealing with this frustrating disease, maybe even yourself.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The thyroid plays a major role in metabolism, growth, and development, which is why so many different symptoms can ensue when hormone levels are off. Intolerance to cold, weight gain or difficulty losing weight, brain fog, constipation, depression, brittle and thinning hair, heart palpitations, irregular menstruation, and others, can all occur from an underactive thyroid. When Hashimoto\u2019s is active (identified through antibody testing), the destruction of the thyroid gland continues and the immune system stays on overdrive.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of this autoimmune component, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.niddk.nih.gov\/health-information\/endocrine-diseases\/hashimotos-disease\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">people with Hashimoto\u2019s are actually at a higher risk of developing other autoimmune diseases<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, like rheumatoid arthritis and MS. The good news is that the right diet and lifestyle choices can work wonders when it comes to treating and healing the thyroid.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Removing gluten is one of many powerful actions that can benefit Hashimoto\u2019s, which is partially due to something called <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/chriskresser.com\/the-gluten-thyroid-connection\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">molecular mimicry<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: the protein within gluten, called gliadin, is molecularly very similar to the thyroid gland. When gluten enters the bloodstream from the digestive tract (which happens due to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amymyersmd.com\/2017\/12\/gluten-blame-hashimotos\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">leaky gut, another thing gluten contributes to<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), and the immune system is already primed to attack thyroid tissue, the body then reacts and attacks, worsening symptoms in the process.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is why I always recommend <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/30060266\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a gluten-free diet to my patients with Hashimoto&#8217;s<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and why they often see dramatic results.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a Functional Medicine approach, there are so many other steps for treating the thyroid, too. We need to address the gut, look at toxicity, deal with stress and sleep, and so much more. If you missed last week\u2019s episode of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/the-doctors-farmacy-with-mark-hyman-m-d\/id1382804627?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Doctor\u2019s Farmacy<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I was joined by Dr. Cynthia Li to talk about her journey in healing Hashimoto\u2019s and taking her life back.
