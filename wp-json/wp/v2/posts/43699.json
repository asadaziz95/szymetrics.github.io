We can\u2019t just say all meat is good or no meat is good, it\u2019s a matter of what types and sources of proteins you\u2019re eating and what the rest of your diet looks like, too.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m excited to dive into all those complexities today with Dr. Stephan van Vliet, who is a nutrition scientist with metabolomics expertise in the Center for Human Nutrition Studies at Utah State University.<\/p>\n<p>We dive into the episode discussing the rise of meat replacements and whether they\u2019re really any better than real meat. It\u2019s become a controversial topic relating to both health and the environment, and Dr. van Vliet sheds some light on what we need to consider if we\u2019re truly comparing them apples to apples.<\/p>\n<p>And while we\u2019ve seen that grass-fed meats offer greater nutritional value than most types of feedlot meats, it\u2019s not always the case depending on the practices used.<\/p>\n<p>We also talk about how the diet of livestock affects the flavor and phytochemical composition of<br \/>\ntheir meat and milk. One of the really interesting things about grazing animals is that they\u2019re able to eat certain plants that we as humans cannot tolerate, passing some amazing phytonutrients onto us. We\u2019re really just scratching the surface of phytochemicals\u2014there are tens of thousands of them. How do they impact human health, and if we\u2019re missing them from our diet what benefits are we missing out on? These are some larger questions that Dr. van Vliet\u2019s work is helping us start to answer.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/embed.acast.com\/5aecaca3a15c2dd12887881a\/63ebcbf602ceee0011d98398\" width=\"100%\" height=\"190px\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This episode is brought to you by Rupa Health, Cozy Earth, BON CHARGE, and Mitopure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rupa Health is a place where Functional Medicine practitioners can access more than 2,000 specialty lab tests from over 35 labs like DUTCH, Vibrant America, Genova, and Great Plains.
