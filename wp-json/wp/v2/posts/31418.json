Since I plan to live to be 120, and I plan to do it well, I have a routine in place to help me maintain my strength and mobility, and hopefully to even improve these areas as I age.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Staying active in youth has been linked to staying physically active later in life. For example, the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com\/track\/pdf\/10.1186\/1471-2458-13-1100\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fit in 50<\/span><\/i> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Years<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> study found that men who had played sports in high school had better physical activity at age 70 and also visited the doctor less across their entire lifespan.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re feeling like high school was a long time ago and that it\u2019s too late for you to get active now, think again. The personality trait of \u201copenness to experience\u201d was a major predictor of good physical activity at age 75, because of a willingness to participate in athletics and try new things. That means, no matter what age you are now, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/us\/blog\/the-athletes-way\/201506\/physically-active-children-grow-be-healthier-adults\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">keeping an open and adventurous mind<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and trying new types of movement in your own routine can help you stay active and healthy as you get older.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And not only does regular exercise help us stay active in our later years, it\u2019s even been shown to help <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedaily.com\/releases\/2018\/03\/180308143123.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">defy the aging process<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
