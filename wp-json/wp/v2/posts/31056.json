Food marketing has convinced us our kitchens are holding us hostage and that true freedom is convenience, found in packaged and fast foods. In fact, 50% of meals are now eaten away from home.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why cooking at home is a revolutionary act. When we prepare our own meals, we can control what\u2019s really going into our bodies, and we also get to buy ingredients that meet our standards and values, like humane treatment of farmworkers and animals.<\/p>\n<p>Today\u2019s guest on <em>The Doctor\u2019s Farmacy<\/em> is one of my personal mentors and idols as a leader in the food movement. Mark Bittman is the author of more than 20 acclaimed books, including the <em>How to Cook Everything<\/em> series. He was a food columnist, opinion columnist, and the lead magazine food writer at the <em>New York Times<\/em>, where he started writing in 1984 and still writes occasionally.<\/p>\n<p>Mark is currently a member of the faculty of Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health and is writing a new cookbook called <em>Dinner for Everyone<\/em> to share how simple and delicious it can be to cook at home, no matter what your dietary preferences are.<\/p>\n<p>This episode of <em>The Doctor\u2019s Farmacy<\/em> is brought to you by Thrive Market. Thrive Market has made it so easy for me to stay healthy, even with my intense travel schedule. I never let myself get into a food emergency.
