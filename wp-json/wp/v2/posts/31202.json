For example, certain types of testing can help us compare our biological age to our calendar age in order to tinker with our wellness routine and achieve the milestones we\u2019re after. With the right steps, we can slow down and even sometimes reverse the aging process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to our biological age, or the measure of how well our body is actually functioning for whatever life stage we are in, there are many things that impact it. Diet, lifestyle patterns like exercise and sleep, and stress are all involved in forming our biological age, along with many other factors like blood sugar, inflammation, and genetics.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This week on <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Doctor\u2019s Farmacy<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, I\u2019m joined by Dr. David Sinclair to explore the topic of longevity and anti-aging and how he reduced his own internal age by more than 20 years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Sinclair is a professor in the Department of Genetics and co-director of the Paul F.

More specifically, their focus is on studying sirtuins\u2014protein-modifying enzymes that respond to changing NAD+ levels and to caloric restriction\u2014as well as metabolism, neurodegeneration, cancer, cellular reprogramming, and more.
