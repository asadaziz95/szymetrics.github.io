Acne rosacea is an inflammatory condition that affects about 10% of adults. While conventional medicine typically treats acne rosacea by prescribing lotions and potions, Functional Medicine seeks to get at the problem\u2019s root cause. In this episode, Dr. Hyman sits down with Dr. Todd LePine to talk about common drivers of acne rosacea, why it is frequently related to gut health, and how they treat patients with this condition.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. LePine graduated from Dartmouth Medical School and is Board Certified in Internal Medicine, specializing in Integrative Functional Medicine. He is an Institute for Functional Medicine Certified Practitioner. Prior to joining The UltraWellness Center, he worked as a physician at Canyon Ranch in Lenox, MA, for 10 years. Dr. LePine\u2019s focus at The UltraWellness Center is to help his patients achieve optimal health and vitality by restoring the natural balance to both the mind and the body. His areas of interest include optimal aging, bio-detoxification, functional gastrointestinal health, systemic inflammation, autoimmune disorders and the neurobiology of mood and cognitive disorders. Dr. LePine teaches around the world, and has given lectures to doctors and patients at American College for Advancement in Medicine (ACAM), Age Management Medicine Group (AMMG), the University of Miami Integrative Medicine Conference, The Kripalu Center in Lenox, MA, and is on the faculty for American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine (A4M).
