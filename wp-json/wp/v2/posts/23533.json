Who does? And with the busyness of everyday life, it becomes all too easy to blow off exercise.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s unfortunate though, since studies continue to reveal the vast benefits of regular, consistent exercise. Being sedentary is very dangerous for your health. People who habitually sit\u00a0have as much risk of dying as people who have bad diets or smoke. Being sedentary also increases risk of cancer, heart disease, and diabetes.<\/p>\n<p>Put frankly, the lower your fitness engagement, the higher your risk of death.<\/p>\n<p>I want to challenge you to change your perspective about exercise, but first of all let&#8217;s get clear about what exercise\u00a0<em>won&#8217;t<\/em> do.\u00a0The mantra of the government and food industry is that people should just eat less, choose a \u201cbalanced diet,\u201d and exercise more. How\u2019s that working out for you?<\/p>\n<p>Despite what popular magazines might say, if you think you can exercise your way to weight loss, I am sorry to say you are in for a big disappointment.<\/p>\n<p>Using exercise to lose weight without changing your diet is asking for failure. You can change your diet and lose\u00a0weight, but if you exercise and keep your diet the same, you may gain some muscle, improve endurance, and be healthier overall, but you won\u2019t shed many pounds.<\/p>\n<p>Consider this: If you consume one 20-ounce soda, you have to walk four and a half miles to burn it off. If you consume one supersize fast-food meal, you have to run four miles a day for one whole week to burn it off. If you eat that every day, you have to run a marathon every single day to burn it off. And if you still buy into the &#8220;calorie is a calorie&#8221; myth, <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2014\/04\/10\/calories-dont-matter\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this blog<\/a> will convince you otherwise.<\/p>\n<p>Simply put, you <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2015\/02\/19\/overeating-doesnt-make-fat-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cannot exercise your way out of a bad diet<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>That said, combining a whole, unprocessed diet with the right exercise does wonders for your health.\u00a0I don\u2019t want you to get the impression that I don\u2019t think exercise is important. It is an essential component of my <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0316230022\/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0316230022&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=wwwultrametab-20&amp;linkId=7UHG3NXGEFE6NBQE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Blood Sugar Solution 10-Day Detox Diet<\/a> and my other plans.<\/p>\n<p><em>In fact, if I could put something in a pill that would reverse almost every chronic disease, it would be exercise.\u00a0If exercise could be put in a pill, it would be the biggest blockbuster medication of all time.<\/em><em style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, nearly half of Americans live a sedentary lifestyle and 88 percent don&#8217;t get enough exercise. No wonder we have an epidemic of broken brains and broken bodies!<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s consider some of the numerous reasons why exercise is important:<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Better insulin sensitivity.\u00a0<\/strong>Exercise makes your cells and muscles <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2010\/05\/20\/5-steps-to-reversing-type-2-diabetes-and-insulin-resistance\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">more sensitive to insulin<\/a> so you don\u2019t need as much. Less insulin means less belly fat.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Reduced stress.\u00a0<\/strong>I often hear patients say a good workout relieves excess stress. That\u2019s because exercise <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2013\/04\/26\/five-ways-to-never-be-stressed-again\/\">reduces <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2013\/04\/26\/five-ways-to-never-be-stressed-again\/\">cortisone &#8211; <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2013\/04\/26\/five-ways-to-never-be-stressed-again\/\">the <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2013\/04\/26\/five-ways-to-never-be-stressed-again\/\">stress hormone<\/a>. Too much cortisol and you become insulin resistant and store belly fat. Too much cortisol also makes you crave sugar and carbs and seek comfort food.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Improved brain health.\u00a0<\/strong>Your brain on exercise performs so much better. Exercise improves memory, learning, and concentration. Vigorous exercise is a better antidepressant than Prozac. Exercise creates brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDMF), which is basically miracle grow for your brain. When you exercise, your brain becomes more elastic.\u00a0Exercise also helps to improve your mood, boost your energy, and reduce overall stress in your body and mind.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Reduced risk for chronic disease.\u00a0<\/strong>Exercise does this through several mechanisms. It\u00a0protects your heart and reduces your risk of <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2010\/05\/20\/lower-your-risk-of-heart-disease-without-drugs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">heart attack<\/a> and stroke. It\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2012\/01\/27\/inflammation-how-to-cool-the-fire-inside-you-thats-making-you-fat-and-diseased\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reduces inflammation<\/a> (the cause of almost every disease of aging). \u00a0And it\u00a0balances hormones, therefore reducing breast and other common cancers.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Enhanced detoxification.\u00a0<\/strong>Besides stimulating the colon, intense exercise allows your body to release toxins through your skin. It\u00a0boosts detoxification of environmental chemicals.\u00a0Vigorous exercise will help you work up a sweat, but gentle exercise keeps your circulation going and flushes out all the toxic fluids that build up in your lymphatic system. Even just lying on your back and putting your legs straight up against the wall for 20 minutes can make a huge difference. If your daily exercise routine doesn\u2019t cause you to sweat profusely, take a steam or infrared sauna, if possible.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Slowed aging process.\u00a0<\/strong>If you want to turn back the clock figuratively, exercise becomes absolutely crucial. I will never forget a movie I saw in my 8th grade gym class about Larry Lewis. He would run five miles back and forth to work every day at (are you ready for this?) 105 years of age!.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Improved sexual function.\u00a0<\/strong>Increased circulation and more energy are two of many reasons that consistent exercise can <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2014\/08\/29\/killing-sex-drive-one-bite-time-5-surprising-ways-sugar-lowers-libido\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">spark up your sex life<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Getting Started<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I hope you can see how exercise enhances nearly everything. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t exercised in so long, I don&#8217;t know where to begin,&#8221; some patients tell me.<\/p>\n<p>I reply\u00a0to begin every day with 30 minutes of moderate exercise. This can have an extraordinary effect on the rest of your day, jump-starting your metabolic engine and balancing your brain chemistry, blood sugar, and hormones so you make better choices.<\/p>\n<p>If you already have a fitness routine, you can continue to do whatever form of exercise you enjoy for those 30 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>If, up until now, exercise hasn\u2019t been a regular part of your life, start with 30 minutes of brisk walking \u2014 or even slow walking, if that\u2019s all you can do. If you can only do five minutes, start with that and do it twice a day and then work up slowly over the week. Walking is easy, it\u2019s accessible to almost everyone, and it doesn\u2019t require any memberships or fancy equipment.<\/p>\n<p>As you get stronger, you can increase your exercise intensity and experiment with other kinds of activities.<\/p>\n<p>Even with the most hectic schedule, you can fit in exercise with these three strategies:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Make it a priority and think ahead.\u00a0<\/strong> Human nature dictates that we are more likely to exercise if we\u2019ve made it easy for ourselves. Get your sneakers out of the closet, choose whatever clothing you\u2019ll be most comfortable in for walking, and make sure it\u2019s clean and accessible. Let\u2019s get the obstacle of preparation out of the way so you\u2019re ready to lace up and go.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Do it first thing in the morning.\u00a0<\/strong>We all know how easily pushing exercise to the back burner and subsequently neglecting it can become.\u00a0Do your daily exercise first thing in the morning to jump-start your metabolism and set your day on the right course.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Make it fun.\u00a0<\/strong>Getting into great shape doesn\u2019t mean hours at the gym, plodding along on elliptical machines or suffering through classes lead by punishing drill-sergeant instructors.\u00a0While\u00a0I hate to exercise, I love to play. I find\u00a0different things that keep me fit. I encourage you to explore all the fun things you may enjoy and save exercise for those times when you just can&#8217;t find a way to play on your own or with someone else.\u00a0Vary up your routine and above all, make it fun. Some of my favorite ways to play include:<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Turn down the shades, turn up my favorite tunes, and dance with abandon<\/li>\n<li>Play a game (tennis, squash, tag, capture the flag, basketball, soccer, volleyball)<\/li>\n<li>Join a sports league where you can play in regular games with others of your skill level<\/li>\n<li>Find a friend to bike, walk, run, hike, or dance with<\/li>\n<li>Do seasonal exercise \u2013 cross-country ski or snow shoe in the winter, and then swim in a pond or walk on the beach in the summer. Keep it varied and interesting.<\/li>\n<li>Take a spin or dance class, like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zumba.com\/en-US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zumba<\/a>. Group exercise makes it easier.<\/li>\n<li>Do something different every day or at least every week.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I hope I\u2019ve encouraged you to get moving to get all of exercise\u2019s benefits. Simply put, you have to incorporate movement, fun, and exercise into your life. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re not going to feel great.
