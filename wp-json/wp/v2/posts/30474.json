But is it really worth all the hype?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, I\u2019m going to tell you what the science says, and it most certainly supports some powerful benefits for different kinds of fasting. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While many people associate fasting with restricting eating for long periods of time, there are actually many styles with different timing, which can make fasting a much more approachable practice than you might think. In fact, many of you are probably already fasting without even realizing it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most basic kind of fast is the break taken between dinner and breakfast. Fasting during this time, which usually falls between 12 and 14 hours, falls into line with our <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5388543\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">natural circadian rhythms<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of when the sun is up or down. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The term intermittent fasting can describe multiple timetables for eating. A 5:2 approach means eating only about 25% of caloric needs during two separate days each week; a 16:8 intermittent fast means extending your nightly fast, taking 16 hours between dinner and breakfast, which many people feel good doing several days a week. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other approaches include a complete 24-hour fast or time-restricted eating where you would only eat within a 6-hour window during the day. You can read more about the different types of fasting on <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ultrawellnesscenter.com\/2019\/03\/27\/is-intermittent-fasting-right-for-you\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this blog post<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from my clinic, The UltraWellness Center. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But why would we want to do any of this at all? Well, there are actually plenty of good reasons. Fasting has been shown to help with weight loss and losing dangerous inflammatory belly fat; it can <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.health.harvard.edu\/blog\/intermittent-fasting-surprising-update-2018062914156\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reduce insulin levels and blood pressure<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, improve insulin sensitivity, and reduce the risk of diabetes; and it helps the brain function better by <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.johnshopkinshealthreview.com\/issues\/spring-summer-2016\/articles\/are-there-any-proven-benefits-to-fasting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">clearing out dangerous proteins<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and benefiting neurons in a way that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3680567\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">protects memory and learning<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And the benefits don\u2019t stop there. As Dr. Valter Longo explained on last week\u2019s episode of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/the-doctors-farmacy-with-mark-hyman-m-d\/id1382804627?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Doctor\u2019s Farmacy<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, fasting can also improve our longevity. Valter explains how this process works on a cellular level and shares some fascinating information on the Fasting Mimicking Diet, a method of eating that allows certain foods at the right times in order to trick the body into thinking it\u2019s fasting. If you\u2019re interested in fasting I highly recommend you tune in to this episode. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One important caveat of fasting is that when you do eat, you still need to eat well. Fasting and then bingeing on ice cream and french fries is not going to get you anywhere. The same dietary guidelines I\u2019m always sharing\u2014eat real foods, tons of non-starchy colorful veggies, healthy fats, high-quality protein, etc.\u2014are an amazing complement to any fasting regime.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s also important to note that fasting isn\u2019t for everyone. For example, those with a history of eating disorders or who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Be sure to talk about fasting with your practitioner to decide if it\u2019s right for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wishing you health and happiness,<br \/>\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mark Hyman, MD<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Everyone in the health space has been talking about fasting.
