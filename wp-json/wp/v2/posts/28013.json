NO sugar\/carbs &#8211; all veggies, proteins, good fats &#8211; but seeing much slower weight loss this time.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Weight loss plateaus are a very common and frustrating issue. When I am working with someone who is having trouble losing weight, despite doing everything right, there are a few things I look at, to see if we can uncover why they are hitting a weight loss plateau.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Today, we\u2019ll discuss four of the most common reasons for a resistance to weight loss.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Nutritional Imbalances<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s2\">Let\u2019s first talk about nutritional imbalances. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3313629\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s3\">Studies<\/span><\/a><\/span><span class=\"s1\"> show these deficiencies are more widespread than you might imagine. Over 30 percent of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22364157\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s4\">American diets<\/span><\/a> fall short in nutrients like <a href=\"https:\/\/store.drhyman.com\/magnesium-glycinate-120mg-90-ct.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s4\">magnesium<\/span><\/a> <span class=\"s4\">and Vitamins C, E, and A<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/store.drhyman.com\/supplements\/10-day-detox.html?cat=2847&amp;p=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s4\">.<\/span><\/a> Over 80 percent of Americans have low <a href=\"https:\/\/store.drhyman.com\/vitamin-d3-1000-iu-60-ct.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s4\">Vitamin D<\/span><\/a> levels. 9 out of 10 people are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3992162\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s4\">deficient in omega-3 fatty acids<\/span><\/a> which, among other things, help cool inflammation and control bl<\/span><span class=\"s2\">ood sugar levels.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Simply put, Americans have been overfed and undernourished for a very long time. In fact, most obese children and adults are actually malnourished. While that might sound contradictory, an abundance of calories does not necessarily deliver the nutrients that your body needs. Actually, the very opposite is true: overeating can create nutrient deficiencies.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">You can eat too many calories and too few nutrients. And guess what \u2013 you need vitamins and minerals to process all those empty calories. Low nutritional status = a poorly functioning metabolism.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p7\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nutrition-based treatment can often help reset your metabolism. You can work with a Functional Medicine doctor or a Functional Nutritionist to test for these deficiencies and put together a plan to correct them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ultrawellnesscenter.com\/new-patients\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The UltraWellness Center<\/a>,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0my private practice, \u00a0we focus on nutrition, using food as medicine and work on achieving balance in all of the systems in the body so that it functions optimally. Our Functional Nutritionists can work with you remotely to detect nutritional imbalances and support your body\u2019s natural ability to heal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Gut Microbe Imbalances<\/b> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">We have over 1,000 species of bugs in our gut, and bacteria cells out number our own cells 10 times over. That&#8217;s a lot of hitchhikers!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">We call this the microbiome \u2013 it&#8217;s the place where all these beneficial bacteria live and work within us to maintain a healthy gut.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">From both an animal and human models, we know that the bacteria in our gut can have profound effects on<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25538312\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s5\"> weight<\/span><\/a> and metabolism, through many types of mechanisms. Some bacteria extract more energy from food, leading to weight gain, while other bacteria will extract less energy from your food, leading to weight loss. <\/span><span class=\"s6\"> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thedailybeast.com\/why-a-cure-to-obesity-could-be-in-your-poop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s7\">Studies<\/span><\/a><\/span><span class=\"s1\"> have shown that taking the gut bacteria from a thin mouse and putting it into a fat mouse can cause the fat mouse to lose dramatic amounts of weight without changing its diet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Some bacteria trigger inflammation leading to a leaky gut, while others are anti-inflammatory. Inflammation triggers insulin resistance and diabetes, independent of your caloric intake.<\/span> <span class=\"s1\">So, clearly, it&#8217;s important to heal your gut if it is damaged by imbalances. I typically recommend working with <a href=\"https:\/\/ifm.org\/find-a-practitioner\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a Functional Medicine practitioner<\/a>, but there are some things you can do on your own to cultivate a healthy microbiome.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\n<li class=\"li9\"><span class=\"s1\">Eat whole, unprocessed, unrefined foods. One of the best ways to maintain gut health involves cutting out the sugar and refined carbs and jacking up gut-supporting fiber.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li9\"><span class=\"s1\">75 percent of your plate should be vegetables and plant-based foods.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Your gut bugs really love these high-fiber plant foods.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li9\"><span class=\"s1\">Eat good fats and get an oil change. The good fats we mentioned earlier (like omega-3 fats and monounsaturated fats, such as extra-virgin olive oil) will help with decreasing inflammation, giving healthy gut bugs a chance to flourish.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li9\"><span class=\"s1\">Supplement smartly. Studies find omega-3 fatty acids <a href=\"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/lite.201500035\/abstract\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s4\">can support healthy gut flora<\/span><\/a>, aside from their other numerous benefits, like reducing inflammation.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>If you&#8217;re not regularly eating wild-caught fatty fish, you should definitely supplement with an essential fatty acids formula<\/span><span class=\"s10\">.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span><\/span><span class=\"s1\">Take a strong <a href=\"https:\/\/store.drhyman.com\/Store\/List\/Probiotics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s4\">probiotic supplement<\/span><\/a> as well. This helps reduce gut inflammation while cultivating health and the growth of good bacteria.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>You can find professional-quality formulas in <a href=\"https:\/\/store.drhyman.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">my online store<\/a>.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li9\"><span class=\"s1\">Add more coconut. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12634436\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s4\">Studies<\/span><\/a> demonstrate anti-inflammatory and weight loss benefits from adding Medium Chain Triglyceride or MCT oils. Some of my favorite fats, coconut oil and coconut butter, contains these fabulous fat-burning MCTs. <\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li9\"><span class=\"s1\">Remove inflammatory fats. Cut out bad, inflammatory omega-6 rich fats like vegetable oils. Replace these with healthier oils like extra-virgin olive oil and coconut oil.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li9\"><span class=\"s1\">Add fiber-rich foods. Nuts, seeds, and a special fiber called <a href=\"https:\/\/store.drhyman.com\/Store\/Show\/Healthy-Fiber\/505\/PGX-WellBetX-with-Mulberry\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s4\">glucomannan<\/span><\/a> provide prebiotics and feed our healthy bacteria.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li5\"><span class=\"s1\">Add fermented foods. Sauerkraut, kimchi, tempeh, and miso contain good amounts of probiotics so your healthy gut bugs can be fruitful and multiply.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Inflammation and Immune Function<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Science now clearly identifies chronic disease and aging as a state of inflammation. And it\u2019s not just allergies, asthma, arthritis, or autoimmunity that are the causes of inflammation.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>We now know that diabetes and obesity are inflammatory problems, as are heart disease, cancer, depression, autism, and dementia.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Your fat cells produce inflammatory molecules that perpetuate weight gain and disease.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Other factors can trigger weight-gain inducing inflammation, independent of caloric intake.

Learning to identify the various hidden sources of inflammation is often critical for those who are stuck in the vicious cycle of the dreaded plateau.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Environmental Toxins<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Many doctors look down on the whole idea of detoxification. But if you were to ask them what happens when your kidneys or liver fail, or if you&#8217;re constipated for weeks on end, you&#8217;d quickly find out just how important the detoxification process really is.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span>Detoxification is a natural process that occurs all the time in the body, though our personal ability to detoxify can become hindered for a variety of reasons.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Unfortunately, in our modern world, we are exposed to a huge burden of toxins from our environment and our diet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">These toxins, including plastics, pesticides, phthalates, bisphenol A, flame retardants, metals like mercury, lead, arsenic &#8211; and any one of the 80,000 chemicals introduced into our world since the industrial revolution &#8211; have been shown to interfere with metabolism and cause <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/25742518\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s5\">weight gain<\/span><\/a> even in the absence of extra calories.<\/span> <span class=\"s1\">These environmental toxins are called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/20689419\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s5\">obesogens<\/span><\/a>.<\/span><span class=\"s6\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">There are many mechanisms by which toxins promote weight gain \u2013 affecting your metabolism, your hormones, and your brain function.<\/span> <span class=\"s1\">Reducing your exposure to environmental toxins is entirely possible.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>There is a lot you can do to cut your exposure to toxins and help your body eliminate the ones it may already contain.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Eat organic when you can and follow the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ewg.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s5\">Environmental Working Group\u2019s<\/span><\/a><\/span> <span class=\"s1\">list of the &#8220;Dirty Dozen and Clean Fifteen&#8221;.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>This list helps identify the fruits and vegetables that are more or less likely to contain agricultural chemical residues.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Stop eating mercury. Avoid big fish with lots of mercury \u2013 such as tuna and swordfish.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Eat clean, organic animal products by choosing grass-fed or pasture-raised animals that haven\u2019t been exposed to hormones or antibiotics. These responsibly raised products cost more, but the reduced exposure to these additives and toxins is well worth the cost.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Be sure to filter your water. Use a carbon or reverse osmosis filter to get rid of hidden contaminants in your water supply.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Drink 8 glasses of filtered water every single day.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Eating lots of fiber helps you poop at least once a day \u2013 this a very important part of the detoxification process!<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Add 1 to 2 cups of cruciferous vegetables daily to assist with detoxification. This includes foods like broccoli, kale, and bok choy, and lots of garlic, onions, ginger, and turmeric.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Don&#8217;t forget to sweat \u2013 this is the body&#8217;s natural mechanism to excrete toxins \u2013 so I recommend getting outside to play or participating in your favorite exercise &#8211; or go relax in a sauna!<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s14\">T<\/span><span class=\"s1\">ake supplements that support detoxification including <a href=\"https:\/\/store.drhyman.com\/immucore.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s5\">selenium, zinc, Vitamin C<\/span><\/a>, and a Vitamin <a href=\"https:\/\/store.drhyman.com\/b-complex-plus.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s5\">B-Complex<\/span><\/a><\/span><span class=\"s18\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\">Take special glutathione boosting compounds such as <a href=\"https:\/\/store.drhyman.com\/sinatrol.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s5\">n-acetyl-cysteine<\/span><\/a>, <\/span><span class=\"s15\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/store.drhyman.com\/alpha-lipoic-acid-600-mg.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s7\">alpha lipoic acid<\/span><\/a><\/span><span class=\"s1\">, and <span class=\"s5\">milk thistle, <\/span>which also support your liver.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">When I work with my patients who are experiencing a weight loss plateau, these are the first four things I immediately take into consideration.
