A Conversation With California\u2019s EPA Secretary"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019re divorced from nature and disconnected from wild places. I think this has really hurt us in multiple ways, some of which we are still figuring out, but especially in the way it\u2019s allowed people to desecrate the land, air, and water we rely on for life.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet people are so resistant to acknowledging climate change and what needs to be done. This could be because of the doom-and-gloom approach many folks take that can be outright depressing or the overwhelming amount of inputs that cause people to simply shut down. It might also just be hard to wrap our heads around how it\u2019s possible to destroy something as vast as the ocean and sky.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today on <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Doctor\u2019s Farmacy<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, I\u2019m hoping to provide you with a different perspective on climate change revolving around hope and positivity. Yes, we still have a long way to go, but we\u2019re seeing some great initiatives and outcomes in places like California where the climate and environment are deemed worthy investments.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My guest today is the perfect person to share about those projects, challenges, and victories. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jared Blumenfeld is California\u2019s Secretary for Environmental Protection. Appointed by Governor Gavin Newsom in January, he is one of America\u2019s most innovative environmental leaders, with more than 25 years of environmental policy and management experience at the local, national and international levels.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jared and I have an in-depth conversation about the actions California has taken to make it a worldwide example for environmental and climate causes. From regenerative farming to electric cars, composting, and renewable energy, we take a look at the many moving parts of a cleaner future and the work it will take on both political and individual levels.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We don\u2019t have to feel scared every time we talk about climate change. I hope you\u2019ll tune in to get a fresh, positive perspective on the solutions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This episode is brought to you by BiOptimizers, Thrive Market, and Beekeepers Naturals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right now, BiOptimizers is offering my community 10% off their CogniBiotics, a brain and mood-enhancing probiotic that contains specifically chosen strains with a high level of research supporting mental health and performance.
