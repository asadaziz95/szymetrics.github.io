That\u2019s why I\u2019m so passionate about taking proactive measures to support a healthy brain before alarming symptoms like memory-loss occur. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Research shows there are multiple modifiable risk factors that influence the likelihood of cognitive decline and Alzheimer\u2019s later in life. This means we have the power to shape the health we want to have as we age, we just need to put a little effort into the present.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/alzheimersprevention.org\/downloadables\/FINGER-study-report-by-ARPF.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The FINGER study<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (the Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability) was the first of its kind to look at how we can prevent dementia using a multifaceted approach based on lifestyle factors. This two-year, randomized controlled trial, with 1,260 participants looked at the impacts of diet, physical activity, cognitive training and social activities, and intensive monitoring of metabolic and vascular risk factors on cognition in older at-risk individuals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And the results provide empowering evidence for the future of brain health. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Comprehensive neuropsychological assessment at the end of the two-year study showed that using a multimodal approach focused on lifestyle interventions like nutrition and exercise had a significant benefit on cognition, including the areas of memory, executive function, and psychomotor speed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For decades we were taught there was no stopping cognitive decline, now we know it\u2019s possible to maintain a youthful brain into old age using accessible means, like what we put on the end of our fork. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last week on <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/the-doctors-farmacy-with-mark-hyman-m-d\/id1382804627?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Doctor\u2019s Farmacy<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I was joined by one of the leading experts in Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia research. Dr. Marwan Sabbagh discusses the exciting and powerful steps we can all take for a better brain as we age, even when we\u2019re up against poor genes. He shares why genetic testing can help us leverage our lifestyle choices even further, why diet is such a fundamental part of any brain-boosting plan, where environmental toxins come into play, and so much more. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Sabbagh\u2019s latest book <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">provides a uniquely hopeful look at his experience working with a woman who had a 91% chance of developing Alzheimer\u2019s and how she got proactive in the face of a terrifying genetic risk. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thomasnelson.com\/p\/fightingformylife\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>You can find <\/b><b><i>Fighting for My Life: <\/i><\/b><b><i>How to Thrive in the Shadow of Alzheimer\u2019s<\/i><\/b><b> by <\/b><b>Dr. Marwan Sabbagh and Jamie TenNapel Tyrone right here for an insightful look into preventing cognitive decline. <\/b><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I don\u2019t just want to live a long life, I want to live a long, healthy, present life.
