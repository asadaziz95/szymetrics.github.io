It can help reduce inflammation, brain fog, and insulin resistance. It can also increase energy and bone density, activate autophagy\u2014the process of cleaning out damaged cells\u2014and reduce the signs of aging. The food we eat has an amazing ability to heal, but the timing of when we eat or abstain from eating can also have profound impacts on our health.<\/p>\n<p>In today\u2019s episode, I talk with Dr. Valter Longo, Dave Asprey, and Dr. Jason Fung about the mechanisms behind fasting, why most of us can benefit from fasting, and how fasting can be a useful tool in cancer treatment.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Valter Longo is an internationally recognized leader in the field of aging studies and related diseases. Valter is the author of an extraordinary book, The Longevity Diet. The culmination of 25 years of research on aging, nutrition, and disease across the globe, it provides an easy-to-understand, accessible, and implementable road map to living well longer through improved nutrition.<\/p>\n<p>Dave Asprey is the creator of the Bulletproof Diet and innovator of Bulletproof Coffee. Over the last two decades Dave, the \u201cFather of Biohacking,\u201d has worked with world-renowned doctors, researchers, scientists, and global mavericks to uncover the latest, most innovative methods, techniques, and products for enhancing mental and physical performance.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Jason Fung is a physician, author, and researcher. His groundbreaking, science-based books about diabetes and obesity\u2014The Diabetes Code, The Obesity Code, and The Complete Guide to Fasting\u2014have sold over one million copies and challenged the conventional wisdom that diabetics should be treated with insulin. His latest book is The Cancer Code: A Revolutionary New Understanding of a Medical Mystery.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/embed.acast.com\/5aecaca3a15c2dd12887881a\/623b8b76fdbe6c001333b58e\" frameBorder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"190px\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>This episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens, ButcherBox, and Rupa Health.<\/p>\n<p>AG1 contains 75 high-quality vitamins, minerals, whole-food sourced superfoods, probiotics, and adaptogens to support your entire body.
