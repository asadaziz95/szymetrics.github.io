This standard American diet (SAD) of refined flour and sugar is the gateway to insulin resistance, diabetes, and other metabolic issues, which cause rapid aging and chronic disease.<\/p>\n<p>In today\u2019s episode, I talk with Dhru Purohit, Gary Taubes, and Dr. Ronesh Sinha about why we need to ditch the high-starch diet if we want to improve our metabolism and reduce chronic disease.<\/p>\n<p>Dhru Purohit is a podcast host, serial entrepreneur, and investor in the health and wellness industry. His podcast, The Dhru Purohit Podcast, is a top 50 global health podcast with over 30 million unique downloads.
