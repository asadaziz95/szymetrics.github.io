This inflammation creates insulin resistance and pre-diabetes, which causes your body to deposit fat not just in your liver but also all around your organs and in your belly. So what is driving fatty liver and the whole cascade of issues it causes? And how do you fix it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this mini-episode, Dr. Hyman speaks with Shawn Stevenson and Dr. Shebani Sethi Dalai about the various mechanisms that are at work when our bodies process food.
