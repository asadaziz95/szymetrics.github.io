Over the past few years, he has responded to several major crises. After an earthquake devastated Haiti, Hurricane Maria ravaged Puerto Rico, wildfires scorched Southern California, and a refugee crisis intensified on the Venezuelan border, Jos\u00e9 quickly mobilized volunteer chefs to prepare meals for thousands of people in need through his non-profit, World Central Kitchen.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On this episode of <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Doctor\u2019s Farmacy<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, I was so happy to sit down and talk with Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, an internationally-recognized culinary innovator, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York Times<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> best-selling author, educator, humanitarian, chef, and owner of ThinkFoodGroup.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout our conversation, Jos\u00e9 shares inspiring stories of how World Central Kitchen is creating smart solutions to hunger and poverty throughout the world. Last year Jos\u00e9 and the World Central Kitchen Chef Relief Team cooked and served hot meals every single day, on five continents, and through 18 missions. From earthquakes in Albania and California to flooding in the American Midwest to the catastrophic damage wrought by Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas, the team responded quickly and efficiently to help impacted communities.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the global coronavirus pandemic, Jos\u00e9 and his team at World Central Kitchen led the charge to provide food relief to the elderly, those suddenly without work, and frontline health care and essential workers by partnering with restaurants, small farms, and local partners around the country. In May, a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers introduced a bill aimed at helping restaurants and feeding vulnerable populations during the coronavirus pandemic. Jos\u00e9 and I discuss the FEED Act and how will it help people suffering from food insecurity and food shortages as a result of COVID-19.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We live in a country where we grow and waste enough food to feed everyone but we don\u2019t get it to the people who really need it. Jos\u00e9 and I look at the fundamental flaws in the system that lead to this, along with so many other glaring aspects of our broken food system. Jos\u00e9 explains that food is a way to empower people and create change. He says, \u201cOne plate of food can change the life of others. We all are citizens of the world. What\u2019s good for you, must be good for all. If you are lost, share a plate of food with a stranger<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you will find who you are.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This episode is brought to you by Tushy, Thrive Market, and the Pegan Shake.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right now, Thrive is offering all Doctor&#8217;s Farmacy listeners an amazing deal.
