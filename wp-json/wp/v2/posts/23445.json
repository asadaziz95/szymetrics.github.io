Do I need to do hormone replacement to feel better, or is there a natural way to get my hormones in balance?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Hormone imbalances are epidemic these days. When talking about hormones, I want you to think of a symphony. All of them interact, so when one gets out of whack, others quickly follow. There are many key players in this orchestra &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2013\/09\/17\/push-pause-button-adrenal-burnout\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">adrenals<\/a>,<a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2015\/06\/10\/a-comprehensive-6-step-strategy-to-heal-your-thyroid\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> thyroid<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2010\/05\/20\/5-steps-to-reversing-type-2-diabetes-and-insulin-resistance\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">insulin<\/a> &#8211; but\u00a0 today, we\u2019re focusing on women\u2019s sex hormones.<\/p>\n<p>While <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2012\/01\/27\/the-ultramind-solution-key-2-balance-your-hormones\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">many things<\/a> can cause an imbalance in our sex hormones, the good news is that many women can fix these imbalances without medications.<\/p>\n<p>You might never know this from conventional medicine, which seems to subscribe to the idea that women are destined to suffer throughout their reproductive life. Women suffer from mood and behavior swings resulting from the three P&#8217;s: Puberty,<a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2010\/09\/17\/how-to-eliminate-pms-in-5-simple-steps\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> premenstrual syndrome (PMS)<\/a>, and peri-menopause (the years leading up to and just after their final period), or the three M&#8217;s:\u00a0 menstrual cramps, menopause and mental anxiety!<\/p>\n<p>Are Women\u2019s Bodies Defective?<\/p>\n<p>Why do sex hormone levels drop up to 90 percent during the aging process? Are women destined to suffer from impaired mood, muscle loss, poor sleep, memory difficulties, and sexual problems?<\/p>\n<p>Of course not!<\/p>\n<p>The suffering related to your reproductive life cycle is unnecessary. It is not a result of bad luck; it\u2019s due to bad habits, such as drinking alcohol and smoking; eating a high-sugar and refined-carbohydrate diet; consuming dairy and often, gluten; not exercising enough; being exposed to environmental toxins; and being chronically stressed.<\/p>\n<p>To think that 75 percent of women have a design flaw that gives them PMS and requires medical treatment is just absurd. To think that women have to dwindle, shrivel, and lose emotional, physical, and sexual vitality is a burdensome, self-fulfilling prophecy.<\/p>\n<p>We now have endless examples of balance and thriving at any age. An 81-year-old female patient once told me, with a twinkle in her eye, about her new boyfriend and their wonderful love life!\u00a0 Thriving is possible at any age and it doesn\u2019t always have to result from a pill.<\/p>\n<p>Simply put, PMS, menopausal symptoms, and other problems are all signs of imbalances in your sex hormones. They are not the result of mutant genes that destroy our sexual vitality as we age. Instead, they are treatable symptoms of underlying imbalance in one of the core systems in your body. Get your sex hormones back in balance, and these problems will usually disappear.<\/p>\n<p>The truth is: Women do NOT need to suffer.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of immediately resorting to a hormone replacement (which might be your conventional doctor\u2019s first line of treatment), you need to figure out the \u201cwhy\u201d \u2013 what is causing the symptoms.\u00a0 If you find that you do need hormones, then you need to find the way to replace them that most aligns with your body \u2013 low dose, topical, bio-identical, short duration.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, figure out what creates these imbalances \u2013 and treat the underlying problem. That\u2019s where <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/about-2\/about-functional-medicine\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Functional Medicine<\/a> comes in: You treat the underlying cause(s), create balance, and symptoms get better.<\/p>\n<p>Most of us are living life completely out of balance. Unfortunately, many symptoms we come to accept as \u201cnormal\u201d are just signs of imbalance, and the type of imbalance that affects almost everyone in our society is hormonal imbalance.<\/p>\n<p>These and other imbalances are all fixable.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Do You Struggle with Out-of-Balance Sex Hormones?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When female patients suspect sex hormones might be out of whack, I ask them to self-evaluate using this quiz:<\/p>\n<p>I have premenstrual syndrome.<\/p>\n<p>I have monthly weight fluctuation.<\/p>\n<p>I have edema, swelling, puffiness, or water retention.<\/p>\n<p>I feel bloated.<\/p>\n<p>I have<a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2013\/12\/27\/5-steps-solve-migraines\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> headaches<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I have mood swings.<\/p>\n<p>I have tender, enlarged breasts.<\/p>\n<p>I am depressed.<\/p>\n<p>I feel unable to cope with ordinary demands.<\/p>\n<p>I have backaches, joint, or muscle pain.<\/p>\n<p>I have premenstrual food cravings (especially sugar or salt).<\/p>\n<p>I have irregular cycles, heavy bleeding, or light bleeding.<\/p>\n<p>I am infertile.<\/p>\n<p>I use birth-control pills or other hormones.<\/p>\n<p>I have premenstrual migraines.<\/p>\n<p>I have breast cysts or lumps or fibrocystic breasts.<\/p>\n<p>I have a family history of breast, ovarian, or uterine cancer.<\/p>\n<p>I have uterine fibroids.<\/p>\n<p>I have peri-menopausal symptoms (hot flashes, mood swings, headaches, irregular cycles, heavy bleeding, fluid retention, breast tenderness, vaginal dryness, brain fog, muscle and joint pain, low sex drive, weight gain).<\/p>\n<p>I have<a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2010\/05\/20\/flax-flash\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> hot flashes<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I feel anxious.<\/p>\n<p>I have night sweats.<\/p>\n<p>I have insomnia.<\/p>\n<p>I have lost my sex drive.<\/p>\n<p>I have dry skin, hair, and\/ or vagina.<\/p>\n<p>I have heart palpitations.<\/p>\n<p>I have trouble with memory or concentration.<\/p>\n<p>I have bloating or weight gain around the middle.<\/p>\n<p>I have facial hair.<\/p>\n<p>I have been exposed to pesticides or <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2010\/05\/19\/how-to-rid-your-body-of-mercury-and-other-heavy-metals-a-3-step-plan-to-recover-your-health\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">heavy metals<\/a> (in the food, water, and\/ or air).<\/p>\n<p>Score one point for every time you answered \u201cyes,\u201d and then check out how you scored using the scale below:<\/p>\n<p>0 to 9 &#8211; You may have a mild sex hormone imbalance.<\/p>\n<p>10 to 14 &#8211; You may have a moderate sex hormone imbalance.<\/p>\n<p>15 or more &#8211; You may have a severe sex hormone imbalance.<\/p>\n<p>Now that you have determined the severity of your imbalance, let\u2019s talk about the one thing you can do <em>today<\/em> to begin treating your symptoms.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Right Diet Becomes Your Number-One Reset Button<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Balancing your hormones is a process, and sometimes it has little twists and turns. But by sticking with it, you can become vital, happy, alert, brilliant, and thriving.<\/p>\n<p>Your diet is the foundation that helps balance your sex hormones.<\/p>\n<p>The first step involves removing the bad stuff. We know that sugar, caffeine, alcohol, stress, and lack of exercise all contribute to<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16868373\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> worsened PMS<\/a> and all hormonal imbalances &#8211; including menopause.<\/p>\n<p>Imbalances in your hormones are triggered by bad food. If you eat sugar, you\u2019ll produce more insulin, more estrogen, and more testosterone. Any type of flour and sugar can lead to these imbalances.\u00a0 Dairy and gluten are often triggers for inflammation and hormonal imbalances. Xenobiotics or environmental chemicals like pesticides in our food can act like powerful hormone disruptors and trigger our own hormones to go out of balance.

Take these in addition to a good multivitamin and mineral with sufficient calcium and magnesium. Probiotics, antioxidants and phytonutrients (vitamin E, resveratrol, curcumin, n-actetyl cysteine, green tea, selenium), and the anti-inflammatory omega-6 fat (GLA or gamma linoleic acid) can help balance sex hormones.

Alcohol \u2013 yes, even red wine \u2013 jacks up estrogen and increases chances of cancer.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to Do Hormone Replacement Therapy Safely<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For 50 years, hormone replacement therapy was thought to be the fountain of youth that would keep women \u201cfeminine forever\u201d until it was found that unopposed estrogen increased the incidence of uterine cancer eight-fold.<\/p>\n<p>For more than three decades, women were the subject of widespread experimentation founded on absent or weak evidence, creating unnecessary harm through increases in uterine, breast, and ovarian cancer, as well as heart attacks and strokes. These methods provide a temporary solution to intractable (and often transient) menopausal symptoms.<\/p>\n<p>Despite potential drawbacks, there are some cases in which hormone replacement and medications are helpful and even necessary for women whose symptoms are unmanageable. Occasionally, despite lifestyle therapies &#8211; diet, exercise, stress reduction, nutrient supplementation, and herbs &#8211; hormone therapy can be lifesaving (as well as mood- and brain-saving).<\/p>\n<p>Only a physician knowledgeable and experienced with bio-identical hormone therapy should prescribe them. I recommend if you go that direction, talk with a knowledgeable functional practitioner who could discuss the pros and cons of hormone therapy so you make the most informed decision.<\/p>\n<p>If you believe hormone replacement therapy might be necessary for you, please discuss the pros and cons with your Functional Medicine practitioner.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve struggled with PMS, peri-menopause, or other problems, what did you find best helped alleviate the issue?
