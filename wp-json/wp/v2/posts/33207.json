Cultivating greater self-love can improve everything from depression to addiction, anxiety, discontent, or numerous other unbeneficial feelings or states of dis-ease.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We just have to open ourselves up to the tools that are out there and be willing to dig deeper.

It also allows us to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/positivepsychology.com\/benefits-of-gratitude\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">practice self-love, feel happier, and become more resilient<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So many of these resources are at our disposal, any time of day, any day of the week\u2014but we have to realize their potential and prioritize their practice before the magic can happen.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you missed this week\u2019s episode of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/the-doctors-farmacy-with-mark-hyman-m-d\/id1382804627?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Doctor\u2019s Farmacy<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, I was joined by Dr. Andrea Pennington to talk about how we can work on our self-love and how that so greatly impacts our place in the world.
