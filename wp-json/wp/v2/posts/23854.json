I never had it.

My acne was triggered by a severe intestinal infection that resulted from an overload of <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/conditions\/mercury-get-this-poison-out-of-your-body\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s4\">mercury<\/span><\/a> and stress.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Right away, my skin changed. My skin color turned gray and I developed dark circles under my eyes. I started getting pimples all over my face (a new adventure for me at age 36), and strange rashes around my eyes whenever I ate certain foods. I even developed itchy red patches on different parts of my body.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">So what did I do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Well, I didn\u2019t need creams, gels or lotions such as benzoyl peroxide, retinoid acid, salicylic acid, glycolic acid peels, or topical antibiotics (all of which might have helped symptoms a little bit).<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I certainly didn\u2019t need oral antibiotics (which can cause long-term gut complications, immune problems and yeast overgrowth), or Accutane (which can cause liver damage and increase the risk of depression and suicide), or oral contraceptives (which I would have been offered had I been a woman).<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While these are the tools of modern dermatology, they overlook the role of overall health in the health of your skin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I didn\u2019t need any of these things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Instead, what I needed was to heal my leaky gut, correct my <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2010\/04\/20\/are-your-food-allergies-making-you-fat\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s4\">food allergies<\/span><\/a> and nutritional deficiencies, <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/conditions\/how-to-rid-your-body-of-mercury-and-other-heavy-metals-a-3-step-plan-to-recover-your-health\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s4\">detoxify from mercury<\/span><\/a>, reduce inflammation, and rebalance my stress hormones.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">And that\u2019s just what I did.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">My pimples vanished, the skin around my eyes cleared up, and my rashes went away (along with my chronic diarrhea, disabling fatigue, brain fog, mouth sores, muscle pain and more).<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A miracle? Hardly!\u00a0I have seen this happen with so many of my patients.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>A Different Way to Approach Acne<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Rather than attack acne through superficial solutions, <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/about-2\/about-functional-medicine\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s3\">Functional Medicine<\/span><\/a> takes a roots-deep approach to acne and other skin problems. From that perspective,<a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/quiz\/oxidative-stress-quiz\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\"> oxidative stress<\/span><\/a> triggers <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2012\/01\/27\/inflammation-how-to-cool-the-fire-inside-you-thats-making-you-fat-and-diseased\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">inflammation<\/span><\/a>, which in turn contributes to acne and a host of other problems.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">What is oxidative stress? Well, your mitochondria (which create energy to run your cells) are built to convert calories and oxygen into energy that the body can use called ATP (adenosine triphosphate). <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Our cells contain a total of one hundred thousand trillion mitochondria, which consume 90 percent of our oxygen intake. This oxygen is necessary to burn the calories we eat in food.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But free radicals are produced as a by-product of this combustion, much like exhaust that comes out of the tail pipe of your car. These free radicals are dangerous because they damage or oxidize the molecules and cells throughout our bodies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This damage is called oxidative stress. More damaged cells equal more oxidative stress or \u201crusting\u201d. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This, in turn, leads to damaged DNA, damaged cell membranes, rancid or oxidized cholesterol (which is what truly makes cholesterol harmful), stiffened arteries that look like rusty pipes, wrinkled skin, and damaged brains.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We have our own built-in antioxidant factories that produce molecules that seek out free radicals and clean them up before they rust our bodies. But these systems are easily overwhelmed by a toxic, low-nutrient, high-calorie diet like the ones most Americans eat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We can get more of these important antioxidant molecules <i>if<\/i> we eat the right foods. But most of us don\u2019t.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The single most important controllable factor regulating the oxidative stress in your body is your diet. Eating too many calories and not enough antioxidants from colorful plant foods results in the production of too many free radicals, wreaking havoc on our bodies and our minds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Oxidative stress, as I mentioned, creates inflammation. While a number of things including toxicity, allergens and nutrient deficiencies contribute to inflammation, the biggest culprit is a processed, sugary diet. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">What you eat becomes the root cause\u00a0of most acne. Along with a high-processed, high-sugar, high-dairy diet, studies show nutrition-related lifestyle factors can <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17616769\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">contribute to and exacerbate acne<\/span><\/a>. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In fact, if I could narrow down the culprits to two, they would be:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Sugar (including flour).<\/b> Sugar raises insulin levels, which promotes the production of testosterone in women, and inflammation in general, causing acne. Large randomized prospective controlled trials (the gold standard of medical research) found people who had higher sugar intake and a high glycemic load diets (more bread, rice, cereal, pasta, sugar and flour products of all kinds) had significantly more acne.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Dairy consumption.<\/b> Hormones (including growth hormones) in dairy contribute to acne. Two large controlled trials found cow\u2019s milk increased both the number of people who got acne and its severity.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Other acne-triggering dietary culprits include processed fats like trans fats, which increase arachidonic acid levels and compete with omega-3 fats in the body, leading to more inflammation and acne.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But the big two \u2013 dairy and sugar (in all its blood sugar-raising forms) \u2013 cause spikes in certain pimple-producing hormones. Dairy boosts male sex hormones (various forms of testosterone or androgens) and increases insulin levels, very similarly to sugar and starchy carbs, which quickly raise blood sugar and spike insulin.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2010\/05\/20\/5-steps-to-reversing-type-2-diabetes-and-insulin-resistance\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Insulin resistance<\/a><\/span><span class=\"s1\">, the inevitable result of chronically elevated insulin levels, becomes bad news. It leads to hair growth on the face and body and loss of hair on the head in women. Many women also get acne and irregular menstrual cycles. For some, it manifests as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), primarily caused by too much sugar, which becomes associated with acne among other problems.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While pimples are not as simple as too much milk or sugar, both have a significant impact on acne. The biggest factor affecting your hormones is the glycemic load of your diet (how quickly the food increases your blood sugar and insulin levels).<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">To reverse insulin resistance, inflammation and other acne triggers, you&#8217;ll want to eat a diet rich in\u00a0omega-3 fats and fiber (to reduce testosterone in women), cut out sugar (to reduce insulin), and consume whole soy foods to\u00a0help balance hormones.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Gut health certainly plays a role in skin health: Foods like <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/conditions\/gluten-what-you-dont-know-might-kill-you\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s4\">gluten<\/span><\/a>, dairy, yeast, and eggs can be problems if you have a leaky gut.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">But many of these conditions trigger or exacerbate elevated insulin levels, knocking other hormones out of balance and contribute to inflammation, metabolic havoc and conditions like acne. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Simply put, to get your acne under control, get your insulin levels under control.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>10 Ways to Eliminate Acne<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">In my practice, I\u2019ve seen numerous patients struggle with acne and other skin problems.
