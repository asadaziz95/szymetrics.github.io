Are you  overweight?  Or do you just have too much belly fat? Do you suffer from  diabetes, monitor your blood sugar all the time, have serious blood  sugar and insulin imbalances, or have elevated cholesterol, blood  pressure, and triglyceride levels? If so, you may find this remarkable  story of one my patient\u2019s very interesting.<\/p>\n<p>One evening, after a lecture in New York, a man approached me about  becoming my patient. He was rotund, with a round, ruddy face, a booming  voice, and a gentle manner. Everything about him was large &#8212; his  appetite, his belly, and his heart.<\/p>\n<p>Sam was nearly 60 years old, and his love of everything big was  waning as he felt the encroachment of death. As we talked, he described  years of feeding his fat, drinking a pint of heavy whipping cream every  night before bed to keep his weight up.<\/p>\n<p>In the end, the big presence that Sam\u2019s 300-plus pound corpus gave  him was not worth the infirmities he suffered. He was diabetic. His  insulin was over 200, normal is less than 20. He also had dangerous  cholesterol levels, angina,  sleep apnea, a sluggish thyroid, and was doggedly fatigued, short of breath at nearly every step, had nasal congestion, swollen legs,  dry skin, and  yeast grew all over his body.<\/p>\n<p>Sam may sound like a hopeless case, but the truth is that everything  Sam had done to his body he did himself and could undo. I told him that  if he did everything I suggested he would lose weight, feel better, and  all his symptoms would go away.<\/p>\n<p>Enthusiastic, though somewhat skeptical, he left my office  determined. Three months later when I spoke to him again, he lost 30  pounds, had more energy, his nasal congestion was gone, his  fluid-filled, swollen legs were better, and all of his cravings were  gone &#8212; he never felt hungry, and he found the program I prescribed to  him easy to follow.<\/p>\n<p>Fourteen months later I saw him again and repeated his blood tests. I  was shocked when he weighed in. He had lost 110 pounds without being on  a strict deprivation diet. He simply changed his eating and his  lifestyle. His diabetes was CURED. His blood sugar dropped from 130 to  74 (greater than 126 fasting denotes diabetes). His HDL and LDL  cholesterol and triglycerides were normal without any medication. And he  was exercising vigorously three to four times a week.<\/p>\n<p>After a lifetime of uncontrollable appetites, Sam finally found  balance and health without suffering. Yes, he changed his diet and  lifestyle, but he was able to continue taking pleasure in food. Most  importantly, he looked and felt twenty years younger.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Whether you are suffering from a little extra weight around the  middle  or you have been diagnosed with insulin resistance or even type 2   diabetes, the fundamental underlying biological causes of ALL of these   conditions are the same.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Now, I know Sam\u2019s story is an extreme one. You may or may not be  suffering from problems as severe as those he faced. Even so, I\u2019m sure  you can relate to some of what Sam experienced if you are overweight,  have high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol, have problems with your  blood sugar, or have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes &#8230;<\/p>\n<p>You may feel twenty years older than you are, and, deep down, you may  even be terrified by the possibility of additional health complications  like heart disease, stroke, dementia, nerve damage, blindness, and  amputation or even cancer. Like so many others that suffer with this  condition, you just want to live a normal life and get back some of your  energy and vitality; you want to turn back the clock and reverse your  diabetes &#8230;<\/p>\n<p>You can do that. I know most people are skeptical when a doctor tells  them they can reverse diabetes, but you can have the same  experience Sam did, and you don\u2019t have to suffer or starve to make that  happen.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Many Names, One Disease &#8212; Defining Diabesity<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You may be one among millions of people who are suffering from a  health problem that is now epidemic in our country. Your doctor might  have diagnosed you with one of many seemingly different diseases. He may  have said you have:<\/p>\n<ol> \u2022 Insulin resistance<br \/>\n\u2022 Pre-diabetes<br \/>\n\u2022 Metabolic syndrome<br \/>\n\u2022 Obesity<br \/>\n\u2022 Syndrome X<br \/>\n\u2022 Adult onset diabetes<br \/>\n\u2022 Type 2 diabetes<\/ol>\n<p>What he likely didn\u2019t tell you is that ALL of these conditions are  basically the same thing\u2014just with varying degrees of severity. The  underlying causes of ALL of these conditions are the same. And because  they are all the same condition, the treatment for all of them is also  the same.<\/p>\n<p>That is why I have set aside these conventional diagnoses in place of  a new name that more accurately defines the health problems you may  suffer from. That term is <strong><em>diabesity<\/em><\/strong>.(i)  Diabesity is the condition of metabolic imbalance and disease that  ranges all the way from mild blood sugar imbalance to full blow  diabetes.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you are suffering from a little extra weight around the  middle or you have been diagnosed with insulin resistance or even type 2  diabetes, the fundamental underlying biological causes of ALL of these  conditions are the same. This is what I\u2019ve discovered in over 20 years  seeing thousands of patients.<\/p>\n<p>Diabesity, in its various forms, affects over 1 billion people worldwide. It is a <em>massive<\/em> global problem, and our current approach to prevention and treatment is  obviously not working because millions more are affected every year in a  dramatic increase of a condition that was once very rare.<\/p>\n<p>Diabesity is also the leading cause of most chronic disease in the 21st century.(<a title=\"ii\" href=\"http:\/\/apps.nccd.cdc.gov\/DDTSTRS\/FactSheet.aspx\">ii<\/a>) Those with diabesity are at an increased risk of heart disease (<a title=\"iii\" href=\"http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/diabetes\/statistics\/cvd\/fig5.htm\">iii<\/a>), (<a title=\"iv\" href=\"http:\/\/jama.ama-assn.org\/cgi\/content\/abstract\/288\/21\/2709\">iv<\/a>), stroke, dementia(<a title=\"v\" href=\"http:\/\/www.neurology.org\/cgi\/content\/abstract\/53\/9\/1937\">v<\/a>), cancer(<a title=\"vi\" href=\"http:\/\/journals.cambridge.org\/action\/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=6788012\">vi<\/a>),  high blood pressure, blindness, and kidney failure. Nervous system  damage also affects 60 to 70 percent of people with diabetes and can  lead to a loss of sensation in the hands and feet, slow digestion of  food in the stomach, carpal tunnel syndrome, sexual dysfunction, and  other nerve problems.<\/p>\n<p>So this is VERY real and VERY serious for those who suffer from the  condition. Given all of this, one would think the questions on  everyone\u2019s mind would be: Why is this happening? What has caused this  diabesity epidemic? Why are our current approaches to treating the  problem failing so miserably? And what new approaches could we take that  would more effectively treat the problem?<\/p>\n<p>Few in medicine today are asking these questions, yet their answers are disarmingly simple.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Problems with Diabesity Treatment &#8212; Symptoms, Not Causes<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The reason our current approach to treating diabesity fails is because it focuses on treating the <em>symptoms or risk factors<\/em> of the disease rather than the <em>causes<\/em>. All of our attention is on treatments that:<\/p>\n<ol> \u2022 Lower blood sugar (diabetes drugs and insulin)<br \/>\n\u2022 Lower high blood pressure (anti-hypertensive drugs)<br \/>\n\u2022 Lower cholesterol (statins)<br \/>\n\u2022 Thin the blood (aspirin)<\/ol>\n<p>But we never ever ask the most important question: <em>Why is your blood sugar, blood pressure, or blood cholesterol too high and why is your blood too sticky and likely to clot?<\/em> Put another way: <em>What are the  root causes of diabesity?<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Answering that question <em>must<\/em> be the focus of our diagnosis and treatment of this disease if we are going to solve this global epidemic.<\/p>\n<p>In truth, diabetes, elevated blood sugar, blood pressure, and  cholesterol are simply downstream symptoms that result from problems with our diet,  lifestyle, and environmental toxins interacting with our unique genetic  susceptibilities. These are the real causes of diabesity.  Unfortunately, few are taking the time to treat them.<\/p>\n<p>Using medication or surgery to treat symptoms like imbalanced blood  sugar, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and the other  complications of diabetes is like mopping up the floor while the sink  overflows.<\/p>\n<p>In medicine today we have a choice. We can continue to mop up this  overflow, or we can deal with the source of the problem and turn off the  faucet\u2014that is, treat the root problems that are causing your illness.  In this three-part blog series, I am going to show you how to turn off  the faucet so you can heal from your diabesity and achieve optimal  health.<\/p>\n<p>The real solution for  diabesity is a comprehensive diet and lifestyle program. And in this series of  three blogs I am going to teach you how you can integrate such an  approach into your life to heal from your symptoms. I will show you why  conventional treatments typically fail, what you can really do to treat  diabesity, and explain how healing the 7 key underlying systems in your  body is the real solution to the problem.<\/p>\n<p>By following this system you may see many of your lifelong health  symptoms evaporate in a matter of weeks or even days in some cases, and  you may &#8212; for the first time &#8212; achieve vibrant health.<\/p>\n<p>Now I\u2019d like to hear from you &#8230;<\/p>\n<p>Do you believe you can be healed from diabesity?<\/p>\n<p>Have you tried conventional medical treatments? How have they worked for you?<\/p>\n<p>Are you ready to try a radically new approach that may help you heal once and for all?<\/p>\n<p>Let me know your thoughts by posting a comment below.<\/p>\n<p>To your good health,<\/p>\n<p>Mark Hyman, MD<\/p>\n<p><strong>References<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>(i) This term was first coined by Shape Up America, former Surgeon General C.
