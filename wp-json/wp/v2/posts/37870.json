The answer is food, and more specifically our food system.<\/p>\n<p>Very few people are able to connect the dots between some of the world\u2019s most pressing issues in a way that lets us see the big picture. My guest on today\u2019s episode of <em>The Doctor\u2019s Farmacy,<\/em> Mark Bittman, is someone who does exactly that in an effort to achieve a different future for food.<\/p>\n<p>The latter is one of the most important books I\u2019ve ever read. Mark asked the simple question of what a good food system would look like and recognized that what we currently have is a food system geared towards profiting a few at the expense of many. It\u2019s also a system that simply can\u2019t endure over time. He wrote <em>Animal, Vegetable, Junk<\/em> to look at where we are and how we\u2019re going to get out of it.<\/p>\n<p>Mark\u2019s approach to improvement involves measured, incremental changes. We take a look back at the history behind our modern food system to understand our current situation, which includes sustained systemic racism, health disparities, and poor monocrop practices dating back to the nineteenth century.<\/p>\n<p>Amidst this global pandemic, where we\u2019re seeing huge investments and fast action to find a cure, Mark and I pause to ask why we can\u2019t see that same eagerness in tackling the chronic disease epidemic. Those with food-related illnesses, like type 2 diabetes and obesity, are at a greater risk of severe COVID-19 symptoms and death. Those same food-related chronic diseases were already an epidemic in our country, yet they receive little acknowledgment as the public health crises that they are. Mark and I discuss this and what types of interventions we need to support as part of a solution.<\/p>\n<p>Mark\u2019s key endpoints for a better food system include getting land into the hands of the people who want to farm it with sustainable and regenerative practices, producing a variety of crops that are healthy to consume, and distributing those crops locally and affordably. That won\u2019t happen overnight, but the future of food can most certainly be brighter if we commit to doing the work and starting with small steps.<\/p>\n<p>I hope you\u2019ll tune in to this week\u2019s episode.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This episode is brought to you by Bioptimizers, Thrive Market, and Athletic Greens.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right now you can try BioOptimizers Magnesium Breakthrough for 10% off, just go to <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/bioptimizers.com\/hyman\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">bioptimizers.com\/hyman<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and use the code HYMAN10 at checkout.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thrive is offering all Doctor&#8217;s Farmacy listeners an amazing deal.
