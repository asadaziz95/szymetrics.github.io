Food sensitivities might affect you immediately or it might take a few days. This can make it difficult to determine what foods might be causing various problems. Eliminating specific trigger foods such as gluten, dairy, grains, sugar, alcohol, and caffeine for a duration of time is a way for your body to hit the reset button on your health. After following an elimination diet for a certain period of time, you can then strategically add foods back in to see how you tolerate them.<\/p>\n<p>In this episode, Dr. Hyman sits down with Lisa Dreher to discuss how they use elimination diets to identify and treat food sensitivities in their patients.<\/p>\n<p>Lisa is a registered dietitian who got her undergraduate nutrition degree at the Rochester Institute of Technology and completed a dietetic internship through Cornell University. Lisa first worked in the acute care hospital setting and became a Clinical Nutrition Specialist working in Pediatric Gastroenterology at the University of Rochester Medical Center. At the same time, she pursued her Masters degree in Nutrition and Integrative Health from the Maryland University of Integrative Health and started practicing integrative and functional nutrition in private practice before joining UWC in 2015. She has since received additional training through the Institute for Functional Medicine.<\/p>\n<p>Over the past 10 years, Lisa has delivered several public health lectures on the role of food as medicine and her work has been showcased in Reader\u2019s Digest, on National Public Radio, and she was featured in the Broken Brain 2 series. She also developed the Digestive Health and Gut Microbiome training module for the Dietitians in Integrative and Functional Medicine practice group through the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.<\/p>\n<p>This episode is sponsored by Paleovalley.
