It causes weight gain and resistance to weight loss. And it causes a whole list of chronic symptoms and diseases. The truth is, most of us have experienced FLC Syndrome at some point in our lives. Yet most people have no idea what causes it or how to fix it.<\/p>\n<p>By now, you may have figured out that<b> FLC Syndrome<\/b> is when you Feel Like Crap. Even though most doctors don\u2019t know how to diagnose and treat it, the science of <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2012\/02\/25\/mark-hyman-at-tedmed-2010-2\/\">Functional Medicine<\/a> provides a clear roadmap for your way out of FLC!<\/p>\n<p><b>Do You Have FLC Syndrome?<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Yes, if you have any of these symptoms:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Excess weight around the middle (belly fat)<\/li>\n<li>Cravings for sugar and refined carbs<\/li>\n<li>Bingeing on sugar or junk food<\/li>\n<li>Yo-yo dieting where you keep gaining back the weight<\/li>\n<li>Feeling tired and sluggish<\/li>\n<li>Brain fog<\/li>\n<li>Joint pain or muscle aches<\/li>\n<li>Bloating, gas, diarrhea or constipation<\/li>\n<li>Congestion, sinus problems or asthma<\/li>\n<li>Allergies or autoimmune diseases<\/li>\n<li>Skin problems: acne, eczema, psoriasis<\/li>\n<li>Mood problems like anxiety, depression or insomnia<\/li>\n<li>Headaches<\/li>\n<li>Memory problems<\/li>\n<li>Low sex drive or function<\/li>\n<li>Simply put, you \u201cfeel like crap\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The fact is that most of us are only a few days away from feeling well, from ending sugar and carb cravings, from having control over our bodies. We\u2019re only a few days away from getting our body back to its original factory settings.<\/p>\n<p><b>Food Is Medicine<\/b><\/p>\n<p>There is a solution. It\u2019s one of the greatest medical advances of the 21st century.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s this<b>: Food is the most powerful drug on the planet<\/b>.<\/p>\n<p>The wrong food will make you sick and the right food will transform your body in just a few days. Food is medicine, and what you put at the end of your fork is far more powerful than anything you will find in a prescription bottle.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve spent nearly three decades in medical practice and research. I\u2019ve seen more than 15,000 patients, performed extensive metabolic and nutritional testing, and synthesized thousands of research papers on the root causes of disease and FLC Syndrome, weight gain, pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes \u2014 or what I like to call \u201cdiabesity.\u201d Based on my findings, I created a simple 10-day plan that can quickly reverse FLC Syndrome and help you lose significant amounts of weight quickly, safely and sustainably.<\/p>\n<p>The result is <b><i>The Blood Sugar Solution 10-Day Detox Diet.<\/i><\/b><\/p>\n<p>We did a trial with 600 people and here were their results:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lost more than 4,000 pounds in 10 days, an average of about 8 pounds each<\/li>\n<li>Reduced blood sugar an average of 20 points<\/li>\n<li>Decreased blood pressure an average of 10 points<\/li>\n<li>Ended sugar and carb cravings<\/li>\n<li>Reduced all FLC Syndrome symptoms from all diseases by 62% in 10 days \u2013 results no drug on the planet can achieve.<\/li>\n<li>Many went on to lose 50 to 100 pounds and reverse type 2 diabetes and other health problems as they continued on the program.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>Why The 10-Day Detox Diet Works<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The secret of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.10daydetox.com\"><i>The Blood Sugar Solution 10-Day Detox Diet<\/i><\/a> is this: We simply swap out processed foods, sugar, flour and inflammatory foods and add delicious whole, fresh, real anti-inflammatory, detoxifying food. Your body does the rest.<\/p>\n<p>The food industry\u2019s dirty little secret is that they have intentionally hooked us on addictive, hyper-processed, hyper-palatable \u201cfood-like\u201d substances that have hijacked our taste buds, hormones, brain chemistry and metabolism.<\/p>\n<p>The scientific verdict is in: <i>Sugar, flour and processed foods are highly biologically addictive<\/i>. In fact, sugar has proven to be eight times more addictive than cocaine. Think cocaine cookies, morphine muffins or heroin lollipops.<\/p>\n<p><i>The 10-Day Detox Diet<\/i> is a goof-proof, step-by-step science-based program that resets your hormones and brain chemistry, and quickly lets you take back ownership of your body. Our biology has been held hostage by food terrorism. <i>The 10-Day Detox Diet<\/i> is a Navy Seal raid taking it back.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re thinking you can\u2019t give up sugar or bread for 10 days, you are an addict. If you start wondering about artificial sweeteners or alternatives to sugar, it\u2019s a profound clue that you no longer own your body \u2013 the food industry does.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s one participant\u2019s story. It can be yours, too. And it\u2019s just 10 days away.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><i>\u201cI was a sugar and carbohydrate addict. I couldn\u2019t go a day without something sugary. I was like a vampire\u2026I had to have it! I sensed, though, that if could go a few days without it I could get past it.<\/i><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><i>I started the 10-Day Detox and was surprised that I didn\u2019t crave sugar. But the way the food plan was designed, I didn\u2019t feel hungry or anxious in any way. I was calm, the food was good, and I didn\u2019t miss the bad stuff I was eating. <\/i><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\"><i>Every day I was on the program I felt more in control\u2026that the food wasn\u2019t in control. Before I used to think, \u2018I know eating this food is bad for me, I know I shouldn\u2019t have it, and yet I can\u2019t NOT have it.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t stop. I didn\u2019t understand that the food literally had physical control over me and that my willpower \u2013 even though I had it \u2013wasn\u2019t enough. I didn\u2019t realize that I was so entrenched in the addiction of the processed foods. They\u2019re right with that commercial, you can\u2019t have just one! You\u2019re sitting there eating it, knowing you shouldn\u2019t, yet you cannot stop. [On the detox diet] I noticed right away that I felt like I was in control over the food, and that was a huge shift.\u201d<\/i><\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px\">\u2014 Jackie Woods<\/p>\n<p><b>A 10-Day Plan<\/b><\/p>\n<p><i>The 10-Day Detox Diet<\/i> is simple \u2013 the daily schedule and theme, the meals and the menu plan set you up for automatic success. You learn what to let go of and what to add into your life. The food, lifestyle practices, journaling, tracking, and community support are all scientifically designed to give you a jump-start to health and weight loss, to end cravings for sugar and carbs, reverse diabesity and put an end to FLC Syndrome for good.<\/p>\n<p>You will also learn how to design your life and health for long-term success. And the food rocks! One person called it \u201cDetox for Foodies.\u201d It\u2019s not about bland boring diet food, but about abundance, pleasure and deliciousness.<\/p>\n<p><b>It\u2019s Not Your Fault You\u2019re Overweight<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The era of blaming overweight people for being lazy gluttons is over. That\u2019s exactly what our government and the food industry would have us believe by saying it\u2019s all about personal responsibility, it\u2019s all about moderation, that there are no good or bad foods, that all we need to do is exercise more and eat less.<\/p>\n<p>But here\u2019s the truth: There are bad foods, there are toxic and addictive foods we should not be eating, and 100 calories of almonds is <i>very<\/i> different from 100 calories of soda. Most nutrition experts, doctors and policy makers still haven\u2019t figured out that a calorie is not a calorie! Some calories make us sick and fat, and some make us thin and healthy.<\/p>\n<p>You can preview my book, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.10daydetox.com\"><i>The Blood Sugar Solution 10-Day Detox Diet<\/i><\/a> (coming February 25th), and <a title=\"Preorder on Amazon.com\" href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/0316230022\/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0316230022&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=10dd-blog-20\" target=\"_blank\">pre-order it on Amazon<\/a>.
