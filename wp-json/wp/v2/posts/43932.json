But in reality, these things are often heavily influenced and manipulated by industry, particularly Big Food, Big Pharma, and Big Ag, which have corrupted many institutions, politicians, professional associations, research institutions, and medical schools. And it has, unfortunately, led to mass confusion and illness in the public.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today on <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Doctor\u2019s Farmacy, <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I sit down with Calley Means to talk about how Big Food and Big Pharma are rigging the system and profiting off of our ill health.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We kick off this episode by talking about Cally\u2019s <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">early career when he consulted for Coke, and his recent viral Tweet, about Coca-Cola\u2019s tactics to ensure taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages failed and soda was permitted in government-funded nutrition programs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our diet is the number one cause of death, disability, and suffering in the world. We are getting sick from cheap, addictive food. Meanwhile, Big Food maintains its own interests by paying off institutions of trust (civil rights groups, dietary groups, think tanks, and research institutions). Healthcare is now the largest and fastest-growing industry in the United States, and that is primarily because of food. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We discuss how <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the healthcare system has been complicit and actually profits off these practices.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is currently a lot of buzz about a peptide called Ozempic that can be used to treat Type II diabetes and is being sought after for weight loss. Despite how it is being touted, it is not a quick fix. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u200b\u200b<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t would also be cheaper to buy every obese child organic food than to subsidize Ozempic! <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Calley and I discuss how <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the playbook being used by Ozempic is the same playbook Calley saw used early in his career.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, we talk about what is needed from a legal and policy perspective to combat this rigged system and why is this truly is a bi-partisan issue.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The policies and industry interests that drive our current system must change to fix our broken food system from field to fork and beyond. If we were to identify one big lever to pull to improve global health, create economic abundance, reduce social injustice and mental illness, restore environmental health, and reverse climate change, it would be transforming our entire food system. That is the most important work of our time\u2014work that must begin now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/embed.acast.com\/5aecaca3a15c2dd12887881a\/640cc54001dfc100110b6aae\" width=\"100%\" height=\"190px\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This episode is brought to you by Cozy Earth, InsideTracker, BiOptimizers, and BON CHARGE.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cozy Earth makes the most comfortable, temperature-regulating, and nontoxic sheets on the market.
