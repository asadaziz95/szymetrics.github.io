Dorothy has successfully completed the <i>Eat Fat, Get Thin<\/i> program and now all of her labs are normal, but her new physician wants her to get back on statins which Dorothy doesn\u2019t want to do. She asks, \u201c<i>What can I say to my physician to keep her from dismissing me as a patient?<\/i>\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">This is a great question. As a diabetic, Dorothy was able to get off of all of her medications and her blood work is finally normal; yet, her doctor still wants her to be on a statin. In this situation, I would consider dismissing her doctor. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>And here\u2019s why\u2026<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">We used to think that there were very few side effects associated with this drug. The truth is, up to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bmj.com\/content\/347\/bmj.f6340\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">20 percent of statin users have experienced serious side effects<\/span><\/a> like muscle aches, pains and damage, as well as elevated levels of muscle enzymes. Statins can also poison your mitochondria, which are your cells\u2019 energy-producing factories and the single most important factor in healthy aging and wellness. Statins can hinder the mitochondria\u2019s ability to produce energy effectively and can even kill cells off completely. Statins can even cause diabetes!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I believe that within five years, or sooner, we\u2019re going to see a backlash against statins because of all of the side effects.<\/span> <span class=\"s1\">You have to treat fifty people with statins to prevent one heart attack, or treat 890 people to prevent one death. It\u2019s just not a very effective drug.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you don\u2019t have a chronic disease or really bad lipids and you haven\u2019t had a heart attack, then statins don\u2019t really work that well. In fact, they cause more harm than good. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I encourage Dorothy to not go back on statins and consider going to a Functional Medicine doctor who can provide the right tests and get her on the right personalized plan for optimum health. Be your own advocate. Remember: Your doctors work for you, not the other way around! <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Now, let\u2019s touch base on another confusing topic for most patients:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>cholesterol test results.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>There is more to these numbers than meets the eye, and<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>if you\u2019re interested in optimizing your cholesterol, check out my <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2016\/01\/14\/7-ways-to-optimize-cholesterol\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s4\">previous blog on this topic. <\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>High Fat Diets and Cancer <\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Our next question comes from Cathy who says, \u201c<i>A lower fat diet has always been recommended to reduce risk for breast cancer. Do you feel this is incorrect?<\/i>\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Let\u2019s start with this: The major cause of cancer is sugar, not fat. Things like obesity, prediabetes and insulin resistance cause cancer, not fat. In fact, at the Cleveland Clinic Center for Functional Medicine, we are doing research on the benefits of a high-fat diet for prostate cancer prevention and treatment. The right fats, such as omega-3 fats, can actually protect you from cancer, but the first step to prevention is getting off of sugar. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Sugar feeds cancer and creates <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2011\/11\/17\/8-steps-to-reversing-diabesity\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">diabesity<\/span><\/a>. The average American consumes about 152 pounds of sugar a year and about 146 pounds of flour a year (and don&#8217;t forget &#8211; flour basically turns to sugar once it is in your body). Diabesity affects over 1.7 billion people worldwide. Scientists conservatively estimate it will affect one in two Americans by 2020; 90 percent of whom will not be diagnosed. The two things you can do to prevent or control cancer are:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\">control insulin levels with a high-fiber diet rich in real, fresh, whole foods <\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s1\">minimize or eliminate sugary, processed, insulin-raising foods<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">I also recommend checking out Siddhartha Mukherjee\u2019s book <span class=\"s4\"><i><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Emperor-All-Maladies-Biography-Cancer\/dp\/1439170916\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer<\/a>,<\/i><\/span> which talks about the effects of ketogenic diets on cancer. A ketogenic diet means that 70 to 80 percent of your diet comes from fat. The key is to eat the <i>right<\/i> fats, which include things like avocados, nuts and seeds, grass-fed meat, wild fatty fish, and coconut and olive oils. Stay away from bad fats like vegetable oils, trans fats and processed foods. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">And above all, do not eat sugar. Doctors tell cancer patients to eat whatever they want as long as they keep their weight up and this is terrible advice. Food is information; it\u2019s not just calories. So you have to put the right information into your body.
