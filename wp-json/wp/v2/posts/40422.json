Levels is one company that\u2019s been spearheading this field, providing an incredible amount of information on blood sugar responses and metabolic individuality.<\/p>\n<p>Today on <em>The Doctor\u2019s Farrnacy<\/em>, I talk to Dr. Casey Means about what we can learn from the 51 million data points Levels has already gathered on blood glucose reactions, and so much more.<\/p>\n<p>I am so excited to talk to Dr. Means and pick her brain about all the data Levels has collected. With insulin resistance playing a key role in the majority of the chronic diseases of our time, monitoring how our blood sugar responds to different foods is a huge step towards prevention and healing.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve ever wondered what\u2019s the worst candy or cereal to eat, or what the best thing to order at Chipotle might be, Dr. Means has some great insights for you. In addition to specific foods that tend to help or hurt a majority of people, we also talk about why combining different kinds of foods is essential for a balanced response.<\/p>\n<p>Walking and other forms of movement can have a big payoff for our health in multiple ways, one of which is blood glucose. Dr. Means shares the results of a study on drinking soda and walking and how to use this information yourself when you eat something that might be less than ideal for your blood sugar.<\/p>\n<p>We also get into her findings on alcohol, what the ideal range for fasting blood sugar might be, and so much more in this episode.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/embed.acast.com\/5aecaca3a15c2dd12887881a\/61f866e69fdcb50012c2bdc0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"190px\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This episode is brought to you by Rupa Health, Thrive Market, and InsideTracker.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rupa Health is a place for Functional Medicine practitioners to access more than 2,000 specialty lab tests from over 20 labs like DUTCH, Vibrant America, Genova, Great Plains, and more.
