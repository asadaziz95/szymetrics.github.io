Any nation that has acquired our habits of eating highly-processed foods, rich in refined carbohydrates, fructose, and inflammatory fats, ends up metabolically unhealthy.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Metabolic health is much more than just maintaining a healthy weight. It\u2019s the sum of our cardiovascular, mitochondrial, liver, gut, and hormone function\u2014and a poor diet impacts all of these systems for the worse.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, I\u2019m excited to talk to my friend and a physician who is an inspiration to me, Dr. Robert Lustig, all about fixing our metabolic health.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Type II diabetes used to be called \u201cadult-onset diabetes\u201d and fatty liver disease was formely only associated with alcoholism. Now, these are diseases we see in some very young children, and a processed diet high in sugar is to blame. Dr. Lustig and I dive into the sad state of metabolic health in our country, as well as in other countries that now eat like us.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He explains how sugar and alcohol act similarly within the liver, harming our metabolic health in the process. He also breaks down the problem with fructose and how the body processes and responds to it differently than glucose.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Lustig shares some empowering details on using nutritional interventions to improve metabolic health. By reducing the percentage of calories from sugar in children\u2019s diets and replacing it with other foods, they were able to reverse metabolic syndrome without any change in weight or overall caloric intake. The real issue they discovered was liver fat, created by high-sugar diets.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are certain tests that can be extremely helpful in identifying our level of metabolic health, one of them being fasting insulin. Unfortunately, this test is often left off metabolic panels at the doctor&#8217;s office. Dr. Lustig and I talk about why you should get it, why it\u2019s normally ignored, and share examples of how it\u2019s dramatically helped our patients over the years. And we discuss other markers of liver health and interpretation issues to be aware of.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also get into the topic of uric acid, why salt isn\u2019t the culprit for high blood pressure, and the eight subcellular pathologies that underlie all metabolic diseases. With 93% of the population suffering with poor metabolic health, this episode could definitely help you or someone you love.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/embed.acast.com\/5aecaca3a15c2dd12887881a\/635bf437bfec520012c77aaf\" width=\"100%\" height=\"190px\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This episode is brought to you by Mitopure, Rupa Health, and FOND Bone Broth.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get 10% off Mitopure at<\/span> <a href=\"http:\/\/timelinenutrition.com\/drhyman\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">timelinenutrition.com\/drhyman<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> when you use code DRHYMAN10 at checkout.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rupa Health is a place where Functional Medicine practitioners can access more than 2,000 specialty lab tests from over 20 labs.
