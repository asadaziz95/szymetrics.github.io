And since the odds are now that 1 in 3 adults in the US will get cancer, this really is a topic that matters to all of us.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The school of thought around cancer used to be focused only on the genetic component. But we now know that our environment\u2014the air we breathe, the food we eat, even our relationships\u2014have an enormous cellular impact on our ability to prevent and treat cancer.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m excited to sit down with Dr. Jason Fung on this episode of <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Doctor\u2019s Farmacy<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to talk about his amazing work in the field of cancer research and why this environmental component should give us all hope.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Fung and I dive into the role insulin plays in cancer and why the right diet is so imperative in preventing cancer or during the healing process. Insulin acts as a growth factor in the body, which is one of the reasons too much insulin leads to obesity. It\u2019s also why insulin will support the growth of cancer cells. A diet high in sugar and refined carbs lets insulin run wild, which is why dialing in our food choices is so essential in the fight against cancer.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Fung shares some fascinating results of using fasting and\/or the keto diet to dramatically decrease insulin. Fasting has also been found as a useful adjunct to chemotherapy, as it helps to put cells into a quiet repair mode which lessens the really uncomfortable symptoms of chemo most people experience.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cancer patients are often told to eat lots of carbs and sugary foods to keep their weight up\u2014this couldn\u2019t be more dangerous! Dr. Fung and I discuss why previous cancer recommendations are outdated and what the future holds for tackling this growing problem.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also discuss obesogens, autophagy, metabolic disease, and so much more on this week\u2019s episode. I hope you\u2019ll tune in.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This episode is brought to you by Bioptimizers, Thrive Market, and Apeel.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bioptimizers\u2019 Magnesium Breakthrough formula contains 7 different forms which all have different functions in the body.
