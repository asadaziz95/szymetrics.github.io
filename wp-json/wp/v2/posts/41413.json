Often associated with the small period of time they became popular in the 1960s, they were researched in clinical, cultural, and spiritual contexts for many decades prior to that. Now we are seeing an uptick in the interest of drugs like this, which include compounds like psilocybin from certain species of mushrooms, for therapeutic uses. Trials are finding amazing effects on anxiety, depression, PTSD, and fear of death by using psychedelics in a responsible and highly controlled environment.<\/p>\n<p>In today\u2019s episode, I talk with Dr. Anthony Bossis, Michael Pollan, and Rameshwar Das about the neurobiology of psychedelics, how they can help to shift mindset, and the story of Ram Dass.<\/p>\n<p>Anthony P. Bossis, PhD, conducts FDA-approved clinical trials in the reemerging field of psychedelic research. He is a clinical psychologist and clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at NYU School of Medicine, where he investigates the effects of psilocybin, a naturally occurring compound found in specific species of mushrooms.<\/p>\n<p>Michael Pollan is the author of the New York Times bestsellers Cooked, Food Rules, In Defense of Food, The Omnivore&#8217;s Dilemma, The Botany of Desire, How to Change Your Mind, and This Is Your Mind on Plants.<\/p>\n<p>Rameshwar Das has been navigating a spiritual path for 50 years. Ramesh met Ram Dass in 1968 and spent time with Neem Karoli Baba in India from 1970\u201372. He learned Vipassana meditation from Goenka in India. Ramesh has worked as an artist, photographer, environmentalist, and writer. He has collaborated on many projects with Ram Dass over the years, including the original Be Here Now and the Love Serve Remember recordings, and he has coauthored three books with Ram Dass: Be Love Now, Polishing the Mirror, and Being Ram Dass.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/embed.acast.com\/5aecaca3a15c2dd12887881a\/6298d39f4c1ee3001245414e\" width=\"100%\" height=\"190px\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>This episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens and Rupa Health.<\/p>\n<p>AG1 contains 75 high-quality vitamins, minerals, whole-food sourced superfoods, probiotics, and adaptogens to support your entire body.
