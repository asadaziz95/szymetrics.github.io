What the Heck Should I Eat? (+ 7 Take-Home Principles)"},"content":{"rendered":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Eating healthy is more confusing than ever. I\u2019ve been <\/span><span class=\"s2\">studying nutrition for 35 years and found that even experts are confused by the science. If the people we look to for nutritional guidance keep changing their views, no wonder the rest of us are so overwhelmed!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">You know what I\u2019m talking about. One day eggs are unhealthy, then the next day they are a miracle food. One year the government tells us to eat bread, pasta, and other carbohydrates as the foundation of our diet, and the next it tells us to cut carbs. The US Dietary Guidelines told us 35 years ago that all our health problems were derived from eating fat and recommended we eat fat \u201conly sparingly.\u201d Over three decades later, they suddenly learned fat wasn\u2019t so bad for us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Then you\u2019ve got the dogmatists who believe you must adhere 100 percent<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>to a particular plan to be lean and healthy, whether that plan be vegan, Paleo, vegetarian, Mediterranean, raw food, ketogenic, high-fat, low-fat, or omnivore.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Lots of factors contribute to this nutrition confusion and contention, including misinformation, personal biases, and conflicting science. Chief among the reasons why so many people are so confused is our $1 trillion food industry that provides us with all sorts of \u201chealthy\u201d options\u2014 low-fat, high-fiber, whole-grain, gluten-free\u2014that are mostly <i>not<\/i> healthy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">All this confusion is enough to make you give up and just eat whatever you want, whenever you want, and in whatever quantities you want.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">That\u2019s why I wrote my new book <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.foodthebook.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s1\"><i>Food. What the Heck Should I Eat?<\/i><\/span><\/a><span class=\"s2\">. I want to help you undo all the beliefs about food that are making you fat and sick and replace them with a new understanding that will lead to health and longevity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Why is <i>Food. <\/i>so different than every other diet and nutrition book out there? Because I organized the information to provide an honest, science-based, unbiased answer to <\/span><span class=\"s2\">the question, \u201cWhat the heck should I eat?\u201d I scoured the best and latest science to provide a roadmap about what to eat. This book cuts through the hype and hoopla to provide a realistic, fact-based, effective, and sustainable way to eat and live.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">In <i>Food.<\/i>, I<i> <\/i>break down 12 categories of food, deep-dive into the science as well as environmental and ethical guidelines behind those categories, and provide practical tools to sum up what I\u2019ve found to determine what you should eat and avoid.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">None of these principles involve deprivation. Instead, you\u2019ll learn to incorporate delicious, whole foods full of flavor, texture, and culinary surprises.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I\u2019ve designed this book to be practical, informative, entertaining, and easy to implement into your busy life. <\/span><span class=\"s2\"><i>Food.<\/i> shows you how to use food as medicine to reset your body and to eat in a way that promotes health. Among the take-home principles I incorporate into this book include:<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s2\">1. <b>An all-in approach to one way<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>of eating may not be the all-in answer. <\/b>You\u2019ve got so many eating options, but<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>advocates believe <i>their<\/i> approach is the absolute best. But what if we could abandon the hype and focus on the best traits of each approach? That\u2019s what I\u2019ve done with the Pegan Diet, which combines the best principles from several eating plans to optimize what foods you choose. In <i>Food. <\/i>I discuss this effective, commonsensical approach to eating that bypasses nutritional dogma for common ground<i>.<\/i><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s2\">2. <b>Much of what we eat is not really food.<\/b> At least, it has been so adulterated and processed we may as well not call it food. It is more of a food-like substance. And as a result, most of us are confused, baffled, and frustrated, not knowing whom to believe or what to eat. In <i>Food.<\/i>, I\u2019ll show you how to scout out things like mystery ingredients and damaging additives that can hijack your health.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s2\">3. <b>If there are health claims on the label, what\u2019s inside is probably unhealthy.<\/b> High-fiber, low-carb, no-sugar-added, the list goes on and on about the many health claims manufacturers boast on food packages. Chances are, they\u2019re hiding what they <i>don\u2019t<\/i> want you to know among the ingredients. Those gluten-free cookies might sound healthy, but flip the package around and you\u2019ll find they contain more sugar than regular cookies!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s2\">4. <b>What you put on your fork is the most important thing you do every day.<\/b> Food is medicine. It\u2019s information. Food is the most powerful drug on the planet. It influences your capacity to live a rich, energetic, connected, soulful life. If you enjoy the real, whole, fresh foods I talk about in <i>Food.<\/i> that you cook using real ingredients, you are positively affecting everything around you. Food is the doorway to living well and loving well\u2014and to fixing much of what\u2019s wrong with our world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s2\">5. <b>Real food doesn\u2019t have to be expensive. <\/b>While it might cost a little more to buy fresh meat, fish, and produce than to eat processed junk and fast food, it doesn\u2019t have to. In fact, studies have shown that eating real food is not more expensive than eating processed food. You don\u2019t always have to buy grass-fed steak (although that is<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>ideal). You can eat well for less. In <i>Food.<\/i>, I\u2019ll show you how.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s2\">6. <b>The real revolution happens in your kitchen. <\/b>We have to cook our way out of our addiction to bad food. Shopping, cooking, and eating are political acts with far-reaching benefits to our health, the earth, the economy, and beyond. Cooking is fun, freeing, and essential to achieving health and happiness. Unfortunately, we have handed the act of cooking, this unique task that makes us human, over to the food industry. In <i>Food.<\/i>, I\u2019ll show you how to take that power back, starting with your very next meal.<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s2\">7. <b>When you feel confused, ask yourself this one question.<\/b> Did a human being make this or did nature? Nature made an avocado, but not a Twinkie. Eating healthy is really that simple.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">Even though <i>Food.<\/i> contains a great deal of scientific information about what to eat and avoid, my hope is that it actually empowers you to make the best food choices. Cooking and eating become infinitely easier when you leave all the artificial stuff behind and focus on real, whole foods.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s2\">I truly believe <i>Food.<\/i> contains all the principles to transform lives. My newest book will help you lose weight, reduce disease, positively impact the environment, and feel better, while knowing you are serving the healthiest foods for you and your loved ones.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\">I can\u2019t wait to share all the information I\u2019ve learned, so you can cut through the confusion and design a plan that helps you cultivate vibrant, abundant health. <i>Food.<\/i> comes out on February 27, 2018. You can learn more about the book, and pre-order it <a href=\"http:\/\/foodthebook.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s3\">here. <\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Eating healthy is more confusing than ever.
