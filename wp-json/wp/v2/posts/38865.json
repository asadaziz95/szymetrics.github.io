Billions of pounds have been applied globally since the 70s. In the US, though we\u2019re only 4% of the world\u2019s population, we use 20% of the world\u2019s supply annually. Then, we wonder why our rates of chronic disease are so much higher than other countries.<\/p>\n<p>The evidence against the use of glyphosate keeps mounting, yet it\u2019s still legally drenching our food supply. I try to be as good as I can about eating organic, high-quality food, and my glyphosate test revealed I was still in the 50th percentile. Studies have linked glyphosate to cancer, endocrine disruption, infertility, immune dysfunction, liver and kidney damage, and disruption of the microbiome. And not only is glyphosate harming human health and the health of our future generations, it\u2019s also destroying our ecosystems.<\/p>\n<p>Today on <em>The Doctor\u2019s Farmacy<\/em> I dive into all-things glyphosate with Stephanie Seneff.<\/p>\n<p>Stephanie gives us an in-depth look at the dangers of glyphosate for our health and our world.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re continuously discovering how powerful the microbiome is for affecting our health. We now know glyphosate directly damages our good bacteria by disrupting the shikimate pathway, a process responsible for producing certain amino acids that are important for gene expression.<\/p>\n<p>It also increases leaky gut syndrome. That means proteins can leak into the bloodstream and create systemic inflammation which acts as a catalyst for chronic disease. Stephanie explains the concept of molecular mimicry and autoimmune disease as well, and how glyphosate ties into this increasing problem.<\/p>\n<p>Glyphosate depletes glutathione, our master antioxidant and a cornerstone of our biology, and it dramatically impacts our sulfur, methylation, and detoxification pathways that have many essential roles for our health. Clearly, glyphosate is a toxin we don\u2019t want to mess with, but to make matters worse, it actually makes other chemicals more toxic because we are less able to process and eliminate them.<\/p>\n<p>Stephanie is a wealth of information when it comes to understanding how glyphosate impacts the body, as well as its impact on soil health, pollinators, and so much more. She is on a mission to understand the full scope of the issue and, most importantly, identify ways to clean up the problem. I am one hundred percent with her!<\/p>\n<p>While Stephanie helps us understand the breadth of the glyphosate problem, she also helps us think about solutions. We discuss some of the potential answers for breaking down glyphosate as well as what actions are needed on personal and federal levels to stop its pervasive use.<\/p>\n<p>Glyphosate affects all of us. I hope you\u2019ll tune in to this very important episode.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/embed.acast.com\/5aecaca3a15c2dd12887881a\/60da1bcab0d64d001b1eb1fd?cover=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"110\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This episode is brought to you by Rupa Health, BiOptimizers, and TrueDark.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rupa Health is a place for Functional Medicine practitioners to access more than 2,000 specialty lab tests from over 20 labs like DUTCH, Vibrant America, Genova, Great Plains, and more.
