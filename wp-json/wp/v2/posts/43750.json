I\u2019m happy to use myself as an example of what we can do to our biology when we take out negative inputs and embrace positive ones: I\u2019m 63 years old but my biological age is 43.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are living in a pivotal time for reframing the intersection of age and health. My passion for this topic combined with the incredible tools I\u2019ve discovered led me to write my new book, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Young Forever<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, so that I could share this life-changing information with others.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today on the podcast, I\u2019m so excited to sit down with my friend and business partner Dhru Purohit to talk about some of the key highlights from my research on longevity.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dhru and I dive into the best way to determine your biological age so that you can begin your own journey of aging backward with measurable data. Functional Medicine provides us with the perfect framework to prevent and heal dis-ease, with the exciting side effect of reduced aging.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there are many areas of life we want to dial in for optimal health and longevity, to me food is the most impactful. We eat pounds of food every single day, which acts as information for our cells and influences our DNA expression. Dhru and I discuss how to give our bodies the right instructions through food and how to reduce certain offenders from your diet to optimize cellular renewal and function. We also take a look at my Pegan food pyramid as a helpful guide in how to build personalized, longevity-supporting meals without tons of restrictions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are ten distinct hallmarks of aging\u2014the underlying common pathways or mechanisms of aging. But each hallmark is influenced by the others and affected by various imbalances\u2014too much or too little of certain inputs that can negatively impact the expression and progression of the hallmark. Understanding those interactions and weblike connections is the key to solving the puzzle of aging, so I break them down into bite-sized pieces throughout my conversation with Dhru.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is possible to change the trajectory of the aging process to age well late into life. I\u2019m so excited to share everything I\u2019ve learned with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/embed.acast.com\/5aecaca3a15c2dd12887881a\/63f53f241561a700116f70e8\" width=\"100%\" height=\"190px\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This episode is brought to you by Rupa Health, Athletic Greens, Joovv, and BiOptimizers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rupa Health is a place where Functional Medicine practitioners can access more than 2,000 specialty lab tests from over 35+ labs like DUTCH, Vibrant America, Genova, and Great Plains.
