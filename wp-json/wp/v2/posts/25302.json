I just feel tired and uninterested in sex. What can I do to get my mojo back?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I see this problem among many women in my practice who suffer libido-crashing mood disorders and other problems that interfere with their personal lives. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While easy to discount low sex drive as just a part of getting older, lately even younger women mention struggling with not being \u201cin the mood.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Conventional medicine often fails to connect the dots between how lifestyle factors &#8211; including our diet (especially low-fat, high-carb and sugar-packed diets),<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>drinking alcohol and smoking, exposure to <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2016\/03\/11\/can-being-toxic-make-me-fat\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">environmental toxins<\/span><\/a>, and being chronically stressed &#8211; contribute to and exacerbate <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3717046\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">sex hormone imbalances<\/span><\/a>. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One recent patient had gone through menopause. She was eating tons of sugar, she was overweight, and she had no sex drive.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I put her on a low-sugar, <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/10-day-detox\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">whole-foods diet plan<\/span><\/a> with plenty of <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2016\/01\/08\/why-fat-doesnt-make-you-fat\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">healthy fats<\/span><\/a>. I also gave her vaginal estrogen and testosterone. Only when we addressed lifestyle habits could we reset her hormones, energy levels and libido.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>The Number One Thing that Kills Your Sex Drive<\/b> <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Lifestyle factors matter, but no contest: The <i>biggest<\/i> culprit that knocks <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24390085\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">sex hormones out of balance<\/span><\/a> is sugar in its many forms, including flour which converts to sugar. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sugar raises insulin and creates a hormonal domino effect. Subsequently, high insulin adversely impacts other hormones. Simply put, excessive sugar can wreck your sex life. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24585109\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sugar also lowers testosterone<\/a><\/span><span class=\"s1\"> in men and alters testosterone metabolism in women. Testosterone isn\u2019t just a guy\u2019s hormone. Out-of-balance levels can reduce desire, increase body fat, lower muscle mass and create fuzzy memory. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s3\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19120115\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Furthermore, sugar increases stress<\/a><\/span><span class=\"s4\"> and decreases energy.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Simply put, feeling energized and maintaining a healthy sex life requires reducing or eliminating sugar. When you normalize insulin levels, other hormones also fall into place.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Beyond that, I\u2019ve found these seven strategies help patients balance hormones naturally to feel energized and maintain optimal libido. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>7 Strategies to Increase Sex Drive <\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Restock your medicine cabinets.<\/b> A major side effect of medications like anti-depressants and birth control pills is low libido. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16913282\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">Birth control pills<\/span><\/a> can decrease testosterone, as can statin or cholesterol lowering medications. Testosterone, in fact, is made from cholesterol. Consult a Functional Medicine doctor to find safer alternatives to these medications. <\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Support your hormones with natural supplements<\/b>. Quality supplements like maca and tribulus help boost your libido.

I recommend possibly working with a Functional Medicine doctor to effectively test for and treat gut imbalances. <\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Stick to real food. <\/b>A whole-food, anti-inflammatory diet will help your body produce healthy hormone levels. Eat phytonutrient-rich foods like leafy greens (spinach, collards, kale, etc.), cruciferous vegetables and healthy fats like grass-fed meats, wild-caught fatty fish and nuts and seeds. Bone broth and high-fiber foods like berries and lentils also provide libido-supporting nutrients. <\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Remove toxins from your environment.<\/b> Minimize <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2016\/03\/11\/can-being-toxic-make-me-fat\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">environmental toxins<\/span><\/a>, which contain endocrine disruptors that interfere with your sex drive. Plastics and chemicals in cleaning products, paints and makeup can contain powerful endocrine disruptors including lead and Bisphenol A (BPA).<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Choose natural products when you buy makeup and household products.
