It is instrumental in keeping you from getting sick and helping you maintain plenty of energy. Unfortunately, however, 90 million Americans\u2014and a growing number of individuals worldwide\u2014have what is called \u201cfatty liver disease,\u201d which literally means your liver fills with fat.<\/p>\n<p>In today\u2019s episode, I answer a question from a listener about how to take care of your liver. I also speak with Dr. Robert Lustig and Dr. Elizabeth Boham about why fatty liver is so prevalent, how to test for it, and how to reverse it.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Robert Lustig is a neuroendocrinologist with expertise in metabolism, obesity, and nutrition. He\u2019s the Emeritus Professor of Pediatrics in the Division of Endocrinology and a member of the Institute for Health Policy Studies at UCSF. He is also one of the leaders of the current \u201canti-sugar\u201d movement that is changing the food industry, in part through his game-changing books. His latest work is Metabolical: The Lure and the Lies of Processed Food, Nutrition, and Modern Medicine.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Elizabeth Boham is a physician and nutritionist who practices Functional Medicine at The UltraWellness Center in Lenox, MA. Through her practice and lecturing she has helped thousands of people achieve their goals of optimum health and wellness. She witnesses the power of nutrition every day in her practice and is committed to training other physicians to utilize nutrition in healing.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/embed.acast.com\/5aecaca3a15c2dd12887881a\/6400c2fa2019d4001173a903\" width=\"100%\" height=\"190px\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>This episode is brought to you by Paleovalley, InsideTracker, Athletic Greens, and Nordic Naturals.<\/p>\n<p>Paleovalley is offering my listeners 15% off their entire first order.
