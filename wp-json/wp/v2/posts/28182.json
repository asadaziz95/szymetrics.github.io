Something was definitely wrong with my brain and my body. But sometimes, a broken brain is not obvious and does not show up in the form of dementia, ADD, or depression. Sometimes, a less than optimally functioning brain can show up in small ways.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I want to ask you some questions:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Do your mood and energy level swing up and down?<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Do you<a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/conditions\/how-to-sleep-better-lose-weight-and-live-longer\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> sleep<\/a> poorly?<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Do you feel tired but wired?<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Do you have to live on coffee in the morning and a few glasses of wine at night just to wake up and calm down every day?<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Do you feel frustrated because you misplace objects or forget names?<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Do you suffer from brain fog?<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Do you find it hard to focus on tasks?<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Do you feel your energy diminishing as the days go on?<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Do you fear losing your job because you\u2019re tired, unfocused, inattentive, and your memory is failing so you can\u2019t properly perform your tasks at work?<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Do you see your relationships breaking down because you are mentally and emotionally absent or numb?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you answered yes to any of these questions, you\u2019re not living with your best brain. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">So many of my patients come in after months or even years of experiencing brain fog, forgetfulness, anxiety, and depression thinking that these are symptoms that will just pass or that there isn\u2019t anything that can be done about them.. Many patients don\u2019t connect how they feel with how they eat, how much they rest and sleep, how much they exercise, how much time they make for friends and community, as well as the media and news to which they expose themselves. Once you understand these connections, you can change you<b>r<\/b> approach to these important factors and to the other dozens of daily decisions you make.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">This is exactly what I aim to address in my new docuseries, <a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/broken-brain-doc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em><span class=\"s2\">Broken Brain<\/span><\/em><\/a>. For this docuseries, I brought together over 50 health and brain experts to talk about what it takes to heal from a broken brain.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The truth is that feeling fully energized and maintaining great brain health ultimately requires taking out bad stuff and putting in good stuff, including both food and<a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2015\/12\/31\/hit-your-reset-button-to-make-2016-your-leanest-healthiest-self\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> lifestyle choices<\/a>. It\u2019s not that complicated, but we just have to know what steps to take.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Many of us get too little<a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2015\/12\/31\/hit-your-reset-button-to-make-2016-your-leanest-healthiest-self\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> good food<\/a>, nutrients, light, air, water, rest,<a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2016\/04\/13\/8-simple-hacks-for-a-better-nights-sleep\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> sleep<\/a>, rhythm,<a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2015\/09\/11\/you-cant-exercise-your-way-out-of-a-bad-diet-but-here-are-7-reasons-why-exercise-is-still-important\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> exercise<\/a>, community, love,<a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2016\/04\/01\/want-a-happy-life-deal-with-the-power-of-your-mind\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> meaning, and purpose<\/a>. We\u2019re exposed to far too much poor-quality food, stress,<a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2016\/03\/11\/can-being-toxic-make-me-fat\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> toxins<\/a> and allergens. All of this creates the perfect storm for health havoc.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The good news is that with some specific strategies, you can take back your brain health. This docuseries will go through the major causes for a broken brain and how we can apply specific strategies to heal from brain disorders. You don\u2019t have to settle with these symptoms forever. Recovery is possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">In this week\u2019s house call I wanted to share my first step for optimizing your brain health. If you answered yes to any of the questions above, I want to tell you about the first step you can take toward a better brain. It\u2019s pretty simple. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Eat. Real. Food.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Yes, food is the most powerful intervention we have and the first step we can take when resetting our bodies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">When I say food, I mean organic (when possible), fresh, local, unprocessed, whole food. And that also means eliminating sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, trans fats, food additives, and preservatives. Stay away from the junk!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Focus on eating colorful fruits and vegetables. Colorful fruits and vegetables contain brain-boosting stuff like phytonutrients. The dark, deep reds, yellows, oranges, greens and blues mean these foods contain powerful anti-inflammatory, detoxifying antioxidants and energy-boosting, brain-powering molecules. Enjoy an array of colorful plant foods like blueberries and dark leafy greens like kale, Swiss chard, spinach, watercress, and arugula.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Also, eat plenty of fat.<a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2016\/03\/30\/fat-what-i-got-wrong-what-i-got-right\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Fat<\/a> is actually very good for your brain. In fact, 60 percent of your brain is made up of DHA \u2013 an<a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2016\/01\/08\/why-fat-doesnt-make-you-fat\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> omega-3 fat<\/a><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>that you get from algae and fish. My brain worked pretty well before, but embracing fat pushed my mental clarity through the roof.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Finally be sure to optimize your protein. We need about 30 grams of protein per meal to build muscle. When you lose muscle, you age faster and your brain takes a huge hit! Eat protein at every meal, including omega-3 eggs, protein shakes, nut butters, fish or grass fed meat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">In the <a href=\"http:\/\/bit.ly\/dr-hyman-broken-brain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\"><em>Broken Brain<\/em> Docuseries<\/span><\/a>, we\u2019ll go through a step-by-step plan to take control of your health, including how to optimize your diet for a better brain.
