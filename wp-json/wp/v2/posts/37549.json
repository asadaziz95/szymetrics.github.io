For one, they are recommendations that would only work for someone who is already healthy, yet close to 90% of our population in the US is metabolically unhealthy. They also don\u2019t take ethnicity and socioeconomic status into account, among many other factors.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a big issue. Clearly, we should be providing Americans with guidelines that will actually serve their health. And research shows that whether we like it or not, as a society we\u2019ve followed the guidelines over several decades and suffered the consequences with worsening health.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today\u2019s guest has been a huge inspiration to me, as she\u2019s challenged the conventional wisdom on nutrition and continues to expose the truth behind our guidelines and the food industry.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nina and I dive right into the many ways in which our dietary guidelines are broken. For example, the current framework recommends 3 servings of refined grains and 6 servings of grains total, every day, and states that 10% of our calories can come from sugar. These are awful suggestions for people with type 2 diabetes and other metabolic disorders, which are rampant in the US. And since 1970, we\u2019ve decreased fat by 25% of our total caloric intake and only gotten fatter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So why don\u2019t the guidelines correspond to our population\u2019s needs? Nina tells us the disturbing truth of industry benefit over what the science says and sheds light on the conflicts of interest happening behind the scenes. She also pinpoints some of the most current research that should be governing our upcoming guidelines and how we can work towards change.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I hope you\u2019ll tune in to gain a better understanding of our current dietary guidelines.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This episode is brought to you by Tushy, Essentia, and Four Sigmatic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Tushy bidet is a sleek attachment that clips onto your existing toilet and connects to the water supply behind your toilet to spray you with clean, fresh water.
