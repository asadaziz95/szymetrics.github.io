When it comes to deciding who is a reliable source, I know Katie Couric is always someone I can trust. I\u2019m honored to have her chat with me for this week\u2019s episode of <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Doctor\u2019s Farmacy<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Katie and I dive into what it\u2019s like to be collectively creating a new normal. She is always on the ground, talking to people during our most urgent crises, and this pandemic is no exception. Katie shares what she\u2019s been hearing from a variety of different sources, from ER docs to psychologists and CEOs trying to save companies, about the challenges and bright spots they\u2019re all experiencing during this time.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We get into the topic of divisiveness in the media and trying to differentiate fact from fiction. Digital targeting, fear tactics, and political interests all play a part in the news we\u2019re exposed to and Katie gives us her personal insights on navigating journalism from an honest place.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I always enjoy talking to my good friend Katie Couric and I\u2019m grateful we could stay in touch and share our conversation with you while we\u2019re all staying in at home. I hope you\u2019ll tune in to hear her grounded perspective on staying healthy during this time and seeking the real facts within the news stream.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sign-up for her morning newsletter, Wake-Up Call at <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/katiecouric.com\/newsletter\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/katiecouric.com\/newsletter\/<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This episode is sponsored by AirDoctor and AquaTru.
