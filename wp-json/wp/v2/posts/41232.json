Emerging research is helping us look at new ways to treat and even prevent devastating neurological diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia, giving people a newfound sense of hope.<\/p>\n<p>In today\u2019s episode, I talk with Dr. Marwan Sabbagh, Dr. Richard Isaacson, and Dr. Jay Lombard about the role of genetics in brain disorders, lifestyle habits you can start right now to reduce your risk or reverse symptoms, and why we need to look at bacteria as a cause of neurodegenerative disease.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Marwan Sabbagh is a board-certified neurologist and considered one of the leading experts in Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia. He is on the editorial board for the Journal of Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease and BMC Neurology and is now Editor-in-Chief of Neurology and Therapy. Dr. Sabbagh is the author of The Alzheimer\u2019s Answer: Reduce Your Risk and Keep Your Brain Healthy and The Alzheimer\u2019s Prevention Cookbook: 100 Recipes to Boost Brain Health. His latest book, Fighting for My Life: How to Thrive in the Shadow of Alzheimer\u2019s, is now available.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Richard Isaacson serves as Director of the Center for Brain Health and Director of the Alzheimer\u2019s Prevention Clinic (APC) at Florida Atlantic University\u2019s Schmidt College of Medicine. He previously served as Director of the APC at the Weill Cornell Memory Disorders Program, Assistant Dean of Faculty Development, and Associate Professor of Neurology at Weill Cornell Medicine and New York-Presbyterian. He remains as Adjunct Associate Professor of Neurology in the Department of Neurology at Weill Cornell.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Jay Lombard is an internationally acclaimed neurologist, author, and keynote speaker specializing in neuroimmunological conditions and medical mysteries. Dr. Lombard integrates biological, psychological, and existential components in his holistic treatment approach. Dr. Lombard\u2019s clinical experience revealed an interesting pattern: one patient with ALS also had small-intestine bacterial overgrowth, another had ulcerative colitis, yet another had Crohn\u2019s, and so on. He started seeing the connections between these bacterial imbalances and Clostridium difficile, or C. diff, and the link to neurological symptoms.<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/embed.acast.com\/5aecaca3a15c2dd12887881a\/627acc0e2591be0013e6817b\" width=\"100%\" height=\"190px\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p>This episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens and ButcherBox.<\/p>\n<p>Right now, when you purchase AG1 from Athletic Greens, you will receive 10 FREE travel packs with your first purchase by visiting <a href=\"http:\/\/athleticgreens.com\/hyman\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">athleticgreens.com\/hyman<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>When you sign up today, ButcherBox will send you two pounds of sustainably caught, wild Alaskan salmon in your first box for free.
