She is the founder of Ziva Meditation and creator of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/cd371.isrefer.com\/go\/zivaONLINE\/Dh109\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">zivaONLINE<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a 15-day course that teaches you to meditate easily, anywhere, and be completely self-sufficient in maintaining the practice for life. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When I first met Emily, we were both lecturing at an event in Greece. I had studied meditation in the past, but I realized that Emily was talking about something new\u2013 something deeper, more powerful, and potentially life-changing. What really got my attention was the way she kept talking about stressing less while accomplishing more.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, the idea of adding yet another demand on my time seemed crazy. Life keeps me extremely busy and squeezing more into my daily schedule seemed impossible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Emily made a compelling case. I took the Ziva course, and I was shocked when I realized just how different this form of meditation felt from what I had done in the past. She combines mindfulness, meditation, and manifesting in a powerful way. I began to sleep better almost right away, but that was only a small part of the benefit. My mind felt clearer; my focus sharpened and I started having even more time in my day! I didn\u2019t realize that I was anxious or stressed, until I wasn\u2019t!<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"su-button-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/cd371.isrefer.com\/go\/zivaONLINE\/Dh109\/\" class=\"su-button su-button-style-flat\" style=\"color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#e75a3b;border-color:#b94830;border-radius:0px;-moz-border-radius:0px;-webkit-border-radius:0px\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Learn to Meditate\"><span style=\"color:#FFFFFF;padding:0px 26px;font-size:20px;line-height:40px;border-color:#ef8c76;border-radius:0px;-moz-border-radius:0px;-webkit-border-radius:0px;text-shadow:none;-moz-text-shadow:none;-webkit-text-shadow:none\"> LEARN TO MEDITATE<\/span><\/a><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To say I was shocked by what <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ziva Meditation<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> could do for me is an understatement. I already was achieving at a high level, but after just a few months, I felt happier, calmer, and less anxious. I have so much more energy. Now, if I don\u2019t sleep well, I can meditate and feel refreshed like I\u2019ve just had a long nap. I used to get tired at the end of the day, but now I get a surge of energy after my second meditation to go out and have fun. For the few minutes I put into meditation each day, I get back at least three hours of focus and quality work. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maybe the most surprising aspect of Emily\u2019s approach is how easy and accessible it is. <\/span><b>This is the kind of meditation you can do anytime, anywhere<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. You don\u2019t have to clear your mind, burn incense, or be alone in the forest. I\u2019ve meditated in conference rooms, in parking lots, on airplanes\u2014you name it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Check out what my community members are saying about how zivaONLINE has helped them:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI watched Broken Brain and was mesmerized by Emily talking about meditation. I\u2019ve been trying several free meditation courses, but none of them did the trick for me. zivaONLINE has become a life-saver in so many ways, and I\u2019m grateful that through Dr. Hyman\u2019s work, I was able to discover a meditation practice that works for me!\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8211; Alla S.<\/strong>\n<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>I just completed zivaONLINE. Emily&#8217;s in depth knowledge and teaching have lead to my sticking with meditating regularly. I am experiencing noticeable changes in\u00a0my sleep and overall feeling of well being. Thank you for what you do!<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8211; Joe D.<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI take Dr. Hyman\u2019s advice on everything, and that has never paid off more than by signing up\u2014without any other advice\u2014for Ziva. I felt like the Universe had been saying, \u201cMeditation, meditation, for the love of God meditation!\u201d for years to me, so when Dr. Hyman said that Emily Fletcher and Ziva were the real deal, that was it for me. I loved zivaONLINE and have been meditating consistently since starting in February. I am so grateful, and am seeing powerful changes happen in my life. Thank you both so much for your leadership on the most important tools for healing that I\u2019ve ever encountered!\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>&#8211; Amy H.<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><i><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, I so strongly believe in Emily\u2019s work that I brought her out to the Cleveland Clinic to train my entire staff of doctors and researchers. <\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"su-button-center\"><a href=\"https:\/\/cd371.isrefer.com\/go\/zivaONLINE\/Dh109\/\" class=\"su-button su-button-style-flat\" style=\"color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#e75a3b;border-color:#b94830;border-radius:0px;-moz-border-radius:0px;-webkit-border-radius:0px\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" title=\"Learn to Meditate\"><span style=\"color:#FFFFFF;padding:0px 26px;font-size:20px;line-height:40px;border-color:#ef8c76;border-radius:0px;-moz-border-radius:0px;-webkit-border-radius:0px;text-shadow:none;-moz-text-shadow:none;-webkit-text-shadow:none\"> LEARN TO MEDITATE<\/span><\/a><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I highly recommend diving into your own meditation practice headfirst with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/cd371.isrefer.com\/go\/zivaONLINE\/Dh109\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">zivaONLINE<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as your guide; meditation is often the missing piece to a complete wellness plan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re not quite ready to commit to the 15 day course, you can sample Emily\u2019s teachings with her free 1-hour 1-hour masterclass, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/cd371.isrefer.com\/go\/SSO\/Dh109\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Stress Solution: 3 Ways to Manage Anxiety (So It Doesn\u2019t Manage You)<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
