After all, Functional Medicine is all about looking at the way our systems function together, rather than focusing on one part of the body at a time. The steps you take to support whole-body health work in the same way. Diet, exercise, stress reduction\u2014they simultaneously affect more than just one aspect of your health\u2014and new research has revealed that choices around these things can have major impacts on our sleep, and how that cycles back to support overall optimal health.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/the-doctors-farmacy-with-mark-hyman-m-d\/id1382804627?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this episode of<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The Doctor\u2019s Farmacy<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, I discuss all-things-sleep with my guest Shawn Stevenson.

He made a decision to get better, rather than pointing the finger at others for not being able to help him feel his best. For Shawn, a lightbulb went off, showing him that sleep, nutrition, exercise, and mindfulness were all essential focus areas in his path to recovering and creating sustainable health.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shawn\u2019s research led him to a profound understanding of lifestyle and sleep.
