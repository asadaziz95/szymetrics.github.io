Though it might seem in the moment that we should push away negative feelings and pretend everything is fine, true healing can\u2019t happen unless we open ourselves to our traumatic experiences and work through them.<\/p>\n<p>Despite what many of us in search of help have been told, this doesn\u2019t necessarily need to involve years of therapy or countless medications\u2014we already have tools existing within each of us to work through the emotional, mental, and physical effects of trauma and feel happier and healthier. I think you\u2019ll be surprised just how accessible some of these solutions are.<\/p>\n<p>This week on <em>The Doctor\u2019s Farmacy<\/em>, I\u2019m joined by Dr. Jim Gordon to take a further look into healing trauma. He is one of the most extraordinary men I&#8217;ve ever met and I\u2019ve been lucky to call him a friend for 20 years.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Gordon is the author of <em>The Transformation: Discovering Wholeness and Healing After Trauma<\/em> and is a Harvard educated psychiatrist and a world-renowned expert in using mind-body medicine to heal depression, anxiety, and psychological trauma. He has worked with traumatized children and families in Bosnia, Gaza, Haiti, post-9\/11 New York, and Parkland, among many other areas across the world facing tragedy and trauma.
