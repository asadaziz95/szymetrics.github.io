Your best bet to overcome them is to prepare yourself for these bumps in the road. Here are 10 tips to help you avoid the holiday pitfalls:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Begin your day as any other day on the plan; do not skip meals to save calories or carbohydrates.<\/li>\n<li>Eat a protein-packed snack an hour before your holiday meal.<\/li>\n<li>Don\u2019t think of the holidays as an excuse to gorge on unhealthy food. Plan in advance to make sure there are options available that you can enjoy.<\/li>\n<li>Scan the spread before putting anything on your plate. Choose wisely!<\/li>\n<li>Set an intention for how you would like to feel after the meal and hold yourself accountable by sharing with a close friend or family member. Or write it in your journal.<\/li>\n<li>Start the meal with a soup, fresh vegetables, or a salad, and avoid any refined flour pastries or sweet appetizers to prevent the cycle of craving.<\/li>\n<li>Drink two glasses of water with lemon before the meal.<\/li>\n<li>Plan an activity to look forward to after the meal\u2014a group walk, visiting with other friends or family, a group game, or playing with younger family members. Or try offering to clean up and help your host!<\/li>\n<li>Eat Mindfully:<br \/>\n\u2022 Take five deep breaths before your meal.<br \/>\n\u2022 Sit next to someone you genuinely find interesting and engage in pleasant conversation.<br \/>\n\u2022 Appreciate the colors and smells of your food.<br \/>\n\u2022 Chew thoroughly and slowly.<br \/>\n\u2022 Put your fork down between bites.<br \/>\n\u2022 Breathe in through your nose while you eat.<br \/>\n\u2022 Express gratitude with others before the meal. Later that evening, write about your gratitude in your journal.<br \/>\n\u2022 Halfway through the meal, put fork down and pause. Take three deep breaths and assess your hunger on a scale of 1-10. Ask yourself how much more you need to eat in order to walk away feeling energized and comfortable. Hint: Usually, this is around \u201c6\u201d or \u201c7.\u201d<br \/>\n\u2022 Close your meal by saying something out loud about how delicious it was and how satisfied you are. Hearing yourself say this can help signal to you and others that you are finished.<br \/>\n\u2022 Have a trusted friend or family help hold you accountable to your goals.<br \/>\n\u2022 Begin and end the day by spending some time alone with your thoughts. Journaling is a great activity to help ground your intentions for the day. Use your journal to set goals, express your thoughts and feelings about how the day went, and track what you ate, how much you exercised and how your body felt.<\/li>\n<li>Most importantly, take time to enjoy healthy, wholesome meals with your friends and family and remember that you can heal your body and mind with each forkful of delicious food you enjoy.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>I wish you the happiest and healthiest of holidays and look forward to hearing your Blood Sugar Solution holiday success story on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/drmarkhyman\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Facebook<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/markhymanmd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Twitter<\/a> soon!<\/p>\n<p>To your good health,<br \/>\nMark Hyman, MD<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A question I am often asked at this time of year is, &#8220;With the holidays just around the corner, how can I make healthy meals that are also delicious?&#8221;
