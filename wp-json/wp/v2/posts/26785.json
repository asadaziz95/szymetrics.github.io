This is an excellent question and one of my favorite subjects because I wholeheartedly believe eating the right amount and type of fat plays a crucial role in shaping health and wellbeing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Doctors, patients and readers are often completely confused about fat, clinging to myths and misinformation that prevents them from understanding the latest science to lose weight and <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2016\/11\/01\/fat-not-make-fat\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">achieve optimal health<\/span><\/a>. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You\u2019re familiar with many of these myths: <span class=\"s2\">Fat makes us fat<\/span>, fat contributes to <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2016\/10\/08\/the-true-cause-of-heart-disease-a-conversation-with-dr-aseem-malhotra\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">heart disease<\/span><\/a>, and fat leads to obesity. Saturated fat is bad, while vegetable oils are good. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Simply put, these and other fat myths are big fat lies. Thankfully, <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2016\/09\/26\/the-skinny-on-fat-a-conversation-with-dr-david-ludwig\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">the importance of fat<\/span><\/a> is finally starting to catch on. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I\u2019d like to think I played a part in this revolution. My latest book, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eatfatgetthin.com\/book\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\"><i>Eat Fat, Get Thin<\/i><\/span><\/a>, came out earlier this year. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">In this book I combined the latest research with my own personal experience \u2013 based on decades of empirical evidence working with patients \u2013 to prove what I\u2019ve long known: <span class=\"s2\">The right fats<\/span> can help you become lean, healthy and vibrant. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Fat is one of the body\u2019s most basic building blocks. In fact, the average person is made up of between 15 and 30 percent fat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Yet for decades, we\u2019ve demonized <span class=\"s2\">dietary fat<\/span>. We\u2019ve diligently followed low-fat diets that almost always equate into high-sugar, high-refined carb diets. This diet contributes to insulin resistance, <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2016\/09\/01\/how-to-eat-12-pounds-of-food-and-lose-weight\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">obesity<\/span><\/a>, heart disease, <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2016\/11\/03\/diabetes-fat-sugar-dr-carrie-diulus\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">type 2 diabetes<\/span><\/a> and many other health issues.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The higher the fat quality, the better your body will function. Stop and think about it:<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>You have more than 100 trillion cells in <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2016\/09\/30\/food-is-information-an-interview-with-dr-christiane-northrup\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">your body, and every single cell<\/span><\/a> should be constructed of high-quality fat. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">How do you know if your cells are getting enough vital fat? Your body actually sends you signals when it doesn\u2019t get enough good fat. Never ignore the <span class=\"s2\">signs your body is giving you<\/span>. Some warning signs include: <\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Dry, itchy, scaling or flaking skin<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Soft, cracked or brittle nails<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Hard ear wax<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Tiny bumps on the back of your arms or on your torso<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Achy and stiff joints<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s4\"><a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2016\/06\/10\/7-steps-to-a-super-brain\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s5\">Memory problems<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Attention deficit disorder (ADD)<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li3\"><span class=\"s4\"><a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2016\/11\/03\/diabetes-fat-sugar-dr-carrie-diulus\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s5\">Diabetes<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Weight gain<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><span class=\"s1\">Cancer<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Dietary fats are absolutely essential for <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2016\/10\/21\/biohacking-101-with-dave-asprey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">health<\/span><\/a>.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Obviously you want to add more of the <i>right<\/i> fats to your diet. To do this, you need to know <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2016\/09\/26\/the-skinny-on-fat-a-conversation-with-dr-david-ludwig\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">which ones to eat and which ones to avoid.<\/span><\/a>\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Most people label all fats as bad and lump them all together in a box. The truth is that all fats are not created equal. There are good fats, questionable fats and bad fats. <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2016\/02\/26\/how-our-government-made-us-fat-and-sick\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">Our government<\/span><\/a>, media, scientists and doctors have advised us to eat the wrong types of fats for too long.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Building the body from the inside out is exactly like building a house. You can frame the house with the cheapest materials possible or you can invest in high-quality materials that are going to be energy-efficient and last a really long time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When you eat the wrong fats, you\u2019re using cheap materials and the results won\u2019t be good. Most processed foods on supermarket shelves are made with poor-quality omega-6 fats from <span class=\"s2\">refined, processed vegetable oils.<\/span> They are abundant, very cheap, taste good and improve texture. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The next time you\u2019re in the supermarket, take a close look at the ingredient list of your favorite packaged food. If the list includes oils from corn, soy, cottonseed or safflower, you are getting a poor-quality fat. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When you consume these subpar fats, your cell walls also become subpar. Instead of being flexible and responsive to <span class=\"s2\">intercellular communication<\/span>, cell walls become stiff and rigid. The more rigid the walls, the slower the cell functions and more vulnerable it becomes to inflammation. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You want to ensure your body has the fats it needs to construct high-quality cell walls. That means <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2016\/07\/01\/the-missing-fat-you-need-to-survive-and-thrive\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">eating more omega-3 fats.<\/span><\/a> Cell walls made from omega-3 fats are more flexible, which allows cells to respond more quickly to messages. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">These <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2016\/07\/01\/the-missing-fat-you-need-to-survive-and-thrive\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">\u201cgood\u201d fats<\/span><\/a> also help your body produce prostaglandins otherwise known as the <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2016\/08\/05\/how-to-fix-your-hormones-and-lose-weight\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">hormones<\/span><\/a> that cool off inflammation. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Optimal sources of omega-3 fats include small cold-water fish like wild-caught salmon, sardines and herring, organic flax and hemp seed oils, walnuts, Brazil nuts and sea vegetables. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Scientists suspect that <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2016\/09\/01\/how-to-eat-12-pounds-of-food-and-lose-weight\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">early humans<\/span><\/a> ate almost equal amounts of omega-6 and omega-3 fats.<\/span> <span class=\"s1\">Our <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2016\/09\/01\/how-to-eat-12-pounds-of-food-and-lose-weight\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">hunter-gatherer human ancestors<\/span><\/a> got healthy omega-6 fats from seeds and nuts. They got their omega-3s from eating wild game and fish as well as foraging for wild plants. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">As people began to refine oils from plants, the ratio became skewed more toward omega-6 fats. This created a drastic imbalance in the modern diet, making us more vulnerable to diseases such as cancer and <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2016\/10\/08\/the-true-cause-of-heart-disease-a-conversation-with-dr-aseem-malhotra\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">heart disease<\/span><\/a>. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">When the human diet contained a balanced number of omega-3 and omega-6 fats, heart disease was almost nonexistent. Today, cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death in the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">The more omega-3 fats you eat, the easier your body can cool off, which means less inflammation that forms the root of nearly every chronic disease, especially those impacting <span class=\"s2\">the brain<\/span> and <span class=\"s2\">the heart<\/span>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s2\"><a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2016\/06\/10\/7-steps-to-a-super-brain\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The brain<\/a><\/span><span class=\"s1\"> is completely dependent on these high-quality fats. In fact, it is made up of 60 percent fat. High-quality fat boosts cognition, happiness, learning and memory. In contrast,<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2738337\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\"> studies<\/span><\/a> link a deficiency of omega-3 fatty acids to depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and even violence.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Your heart will also thank you for eating more omega-3s, which help lower levels of bad fats (triglycerides) and raise levels of good fats (HDL). Omega-3 fats make blood more slippery, reducing the likelihood of <span class=\"s2\">artery disease<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2016\/10\/08\/the-true-cause-of-heart-disease-a-conversation-with-dr-aseem-malhotra\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">.<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Beyond nourishing your heart and<span class=\"s2\"> brain<\/span>, eating the right fats helps you shed fat. Paradoxical as it sounds, not eating fat or eating the wrong types of fat make you <i>gain<\/i> weight. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">That\u2019s because healthy cell walls made from high-quality fats lowers blood sugar and insulin levels, meaning you\u2019re more likely to burn than store fat.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>Consuming healthy fats also helps us absorb the important fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Besides eating plenty of wild, fatty fish, optimize your fat intake with nuts and seeds, <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2016\/04\/06\/is-coconut-oil-bad-for-your-cholesterol\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">coconut oil<\/span><\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2016\/08\/25\/is-butter-really-back\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">grass-fed butter<\/span><\/a> (or ghee if you\u2019re dairy sensitive), avocados, <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2016\/01\/22\/is-meat-good-or-bad-for-you\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">grass-fed meats<\/span><\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2016\/03\/17\/is-your-olive-oil-really-olive-oil\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">extra-virgin olive oil<\/span><\/a> and olives. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">If you\u2019re still curious about whether you\u2019re getting enough fat in your diet, take <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/q\/are-you-getting-enough-fat-quiz\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">this quiz<\/span><\/a>.
