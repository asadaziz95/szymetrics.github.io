For my good friend and fellow Functional Medicine doctor Elizabeth Boham, it was triple-negative breast cancer diagnosed at the young age of 30, despite already embracing many principles of a healthy life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going through these experiences has led us to want to help others heal on the deepest level, which is what brought us both to the power using Functional Medicine and food and lifestyle choices to truly heal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This week on <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Doctor\u2019s Farmacy<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Dr. Boham joins me to discuss what it means to get to the root cause of disease and how the principles we practice do exactly that.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Boham is a physician and nutritionist who practices Functional Medicine as part of my team at The UltraWellness Center in Lenox, MA. Through her practice and lecturing, she has helped thousands of people achieve their wellness goals. She is part of the faculty of the Institute for Functional Medicine and has been featured on the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Oz<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> show and in a variety of publications and media including <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Huffington Post<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Chalkboard Magazine<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Experience Life<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Her DVD <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Breast Wellness: Tools to Prevent and Heal from Breast Cancer <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">explores the Functional Medicine approach to keeping your breasts and whole body well, a topic she is passionate about as a breast cancer survivor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This episode of <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Doctor\u2019s Farmacy<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is brought to you by Theragun and by Thrive Market.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Theragun has quickly become one of my favorite tools to relieve my muscle soreness and give my body a deep massage at home.
