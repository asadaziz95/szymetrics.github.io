But it\u2019s something we\u2019re never taught in school and often pressured to ignore when it comes to \u201cbeing professional.\u201d Luckily, emotional intelligence is something we can work on and grow like many other parts of our lives\u2014you probably won\u2019t be surprised that meditation is one way to do just that.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personally, I have noticed that when I\u2019m staying current with my meditation practice, I\u2019m less easily triggered and more emotionally resilient, which allows me to be more present for my family and my work.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This week on <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Doctor\u2019s Farmacy<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, I had the pleasure of sitting down with my good friend Dan Goleman to talk about cultivating emotional intelligence through meditation, and why it matters more than you might think.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dan is best known for his worldwide bestseller <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Emotional Intelligence <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and most recently co-authored the book <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Altered Traits: Science Reveals How Meditation Changes Your Mind, Brain and Body. <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goleman has been ranked among the 25 most influential business leaders by several business publications including <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TIME <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Wall Street Journal. <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apart from his writing on emotional intelligence, Goleman has written books on topics including self-deception, creativity, transparency, meditation, social and emotional learning, eco-literacy, and the ecological
