I walked into Staples a few weeks ago for office supplies and was met with endless amounts of candy at the register. It used to be that we just had to avoid falling into the traps of junk at the grocery store, but now, junk food is ubiquitous and demanding our attention in the forms of marketing and easy access.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So often doctors tell their patients, just eat less and exercise more. The patient who is overweight is often blamed and called a lazy glutton who doesn\u2019t have enough willpower.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, willpower is not enough. Patients aren\u2019t simply lacking in self-discipline. They are not weak and lazy. Most of them are biologically addicted to sugar, and it\u2019s no wonder! <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Willpower is not enough to stand up to easy, cheap, convenient food. We need more than willpower. We need solutions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My guest on this week\u2019s episode of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/the-doctors-farmacy-with-mark-hyman-m-d\/id1382804627?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Doctor\u2019s Farmacy<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is Dr. Sean Lucan, a practicing family physician in the Bronx treating children and adults. He is an award-winning NIH-funded investigator who has published numerous articles on food-related issues.\u00a0Dr. Lucan has co-authored one textbook on nutrition and another on biostatistics, epidemiology, preventive medicine, and public health.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Lucan&#8217;s research focuses on how different aspects of urban food environments may influence what people eat, and what the implications are for obesity and chronic diseases, particularly in low-income and minority communities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/the-doctors-farmacy-with-mark-hyman-m-d\/id1382804627?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This week<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Dr. Lucan and I talk about food environments\u2014essentially how our surroundings dictate our food choices, and how OSBs (other storefront businesses, places like gyms, laundromats, the barbershop, etc\u2026) are becoming a huge source of providing junk to both children and adults. It all comes down to this: grazing vs. grocery environments. Areas that are defined by greater poverty have more grazing environments, which is doing a lot more damage than we could have imagined. Unfortunately, people with plenty of grazing grab-and-go options are more likely to make poor choices around food.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also talk about food and beverage marketing to youth, and Dr. Lucan\u2019s campaign to protect youth from dangerous marketing which led to a ban on alcohol advertising.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dr. Lucan also presents solutions. How can we change the food environments, especially in disenfranchised areas, so that people are able to make better choices around the food that they eat.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I hope you enjoy <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/the-doctors-farmacy-with-mark-hyman-m-d\/id1382804627?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this episode<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as much as I did.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Junk food is everywhere.
