Along those same lines, many of the processed foods in our Standard American Diet are sabotaging our brain health with loads of excess sugar and other sneaky ingredients.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, I\u2019m excited to sit down with Max Lugavere to explore what it looks like to eat a diet that specifically benefits the brain. If you\u2019re thinking you don\u2019t need that focus in your personal diet, think again: these habits and foods are benefiting your entire body, too.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The brain is predominantly made of fat, which happens to be the type of fat that is most susceptible to oxidation. Max and I dive into why the right fats are so foundational for brain health and what some of his favorite options are.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you look at most processed foods you\u2019ll notice two things: they\u2019re missing healthy fats and protein. That\u2019s intentional because sugar and starch are addicting and keep us eating without ever feeling full. Max shares that, thanks to this strategy of the food industry, the concept of \u201cintuitive eating\u201d just doesn\u2019t work.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A defining factor of foods that support optimal brain function, which Max calls \u201cgenius foods,\u201d is their phytochemical richness. This is an area of nutrition most people aren\u2019t paying attention to, but it\u2019s one that has the potential to completely overhaul our health. Max and I talk about eating in a phytochemical-rich way, as well as how to get the most benefits from certain food groups like meat and dairy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/embed.acast.com\/5aecaca3a15c2dd12887881a\/6242328524820b0012cc82f3\" width=\"100%\" height=\"190px\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This episode is brought to you by Eight Sleep, Rupa Health, and InsideTracker.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eight Sleep\u2019s Pod Pro mattress is so smart that it adjusts your temperature and also gives you individualized recommendations on how to sleep better the next night.
