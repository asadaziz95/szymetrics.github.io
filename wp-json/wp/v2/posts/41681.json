We often go into them looking for others to fulfill whatever we refuse to give ourselves. We want our unmet needs to be met by this other person, without doing the inner work to help ourselves.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Owning our needs actually makes it easier for other people to meet our needs. This sounds counterintuitive, but it\u2019s one of those breakthroughs that can really turn toxic relationship patterns around.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today I\u2019m excited to share a conversation with my good friend Angelika Alana, all about tuning into our bodies, our physical and emotional needs, and healing our connection to ourselves and others.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to failed relationships and sexual challenges, we can be pretty hard on ourselves. But these are two major areas of life we are never really taught how to succeed in. Angelika is an amazing resource for doing the tough work that allows us to learn what we need, what we want, and how to communicate that to others in a safe and effective way.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sex is a hard topic for many people to talk about, whether it\u2019s due to trauma, physical issues like pain, lack of pleasure, or any number of reasons. Angelika and I dig into how somatic therapy can help break down the walls we\u2019ve put up around sex. She explains what somatic therapy entails and what some of the steps she takes with clients look like, as well as some inspiring success stories.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nervous system dysregulation is a common issue in negative relationship patterns, sexual dysfunction, and an overall feeling of unhappiness or anxiety. When we get comfortable being in our bodies and honoring our feelings, we can improve all of these issues and more. That\u2019s the goal of somatic therapy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/embed.acast.com\/5aecaca3a15c2dd12887881a\/62c46cd56cf65700197ca567\" width=\"100%\" height=\"190px\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This episode is brought to you by Gut Food, BiOptimizers, InsideTracker, and Pendulum.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gut Food uses the power of three critical gut-supporting components\u2014prebiotics, probiotics, and polyphenols\u2014and five ingredients at clinically validated dosages to help reduce inflammation, support the growth of beneficial gut bacteria, improve digestion and bloating, and support mood &amp; energy.
