Can I use those instead?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Sadly, the answer is emphatically <i>no<\/i>. Human, animal, experimental, and other studies show artificial sweeteners can be <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/pmc2892765\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">just as bad and maybe even worse<\/span><\/a> than regular sugar. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Artificial sweeteners have long been positioned as \u201cguilt-free,\u201d innocuous, safe alternatives, so why would I argue they are actually <i>worse<\/i> than sugar?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Manufacturers love to position zero-calorie sweetened foods and drinks as better because they create a \u201chalo effect\u201d and they know you\u2019re more likely to buy them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We\u2019re surrounded by low-calorie or calorie-free foods and diet soft drinks that contain artificial sweeteners touted as healthy or consequence-free. As a result, the number of Americans who consume products that contain sugar-free sweeteners grew from 70 million in 1987 to 160 million in 2000.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">At the same time, the incidence of obesity in the United States has doubled from 15 percent to 30 percent across all age groups, ethnic groups, and social strata. And the number of overweight Americans has increased from about 30 percent to over 65 percent of the population. The fastest growing obese population is children.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">High sugar intake deservedly takes the blame here, but we frequently overlook artificial sweeteners as a potential culprit. The evidence is catching up. Recent studies have not been kind to artificial sweeteners, claiming among other problems they<a href=\"http:\/\/www.eurekalert.org\/pub_releases\/2014-09\/wios-gba091514.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <span class=\"s2\">adversely affect gut health and glucose tolerance<\/span><\/a>. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">You\u2019re probably wondering, though, how a calorie-free sweetener could make you fat. If you\u2019ve read my blogs, you know that while calories count, other factors<a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2015\/02\/13\/focusing-calories-misses-bigger-picture-weight-health\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <span class=\"s2\">like hormonal imbalances<\/span><\/a> contribute far more to weight gain. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Let\u2019s briefly look at three reasons artificial sweeteners create adverse consequences to your waistline and health.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Artificial sweeteners increase your risk for<\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2011\/11\/17\/8-steps-to-reversing-diabesity\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b> <\/b><span class=\"s2\"><b>diabesity<\/b><\/span><\/a><b>. <\/b>Studies show sugar substitutes potentially can <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/pmc3772345\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">increase your risk<\/span><\/a> for weight gain, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. One study of rats that were fed artificially sweetened food found that their metabolism slowed down and they were triggered to<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18298259\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <span class=\"s2\">consume more calories and gain more weight<\/span><\/a> than rats fed sugar-sweetened food. In another animal study, rats that consumed artificial sweeteners ate more food, their metabolic fire or thermogenesis slowed down, and they<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/?term=A+Role+for+Sweet+Taste%25253A+Calorie+Predictive+Relations+in+Energy+Regulation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <span class=\"s2\">put on 14 percent more body fat in just two weeks<\/span><\/a> even if they ate fewer total calories than the rats that ate regular sugar-sweetened food.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Artificial sweeteners rewire your brain chemistry and metabolism. <\/b>How could aspartame and other fake sweeteners make you gain weight even though they\u2019re calorie-free? Because they stimulate your taste buds and trick them to think you\u2019re eating real sugar. Artificial sweeteners can be 1000 times sweeter than sugar, so your body becomes confused and revs up production of <a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2014\/08\/18\/one-test-doctor-isnt-save-life\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"s2\">insulin<\/span><\/a>, your fat-storage hormone. Your metabolism slows down, you become hungry more quickly, you\u2019re prone to eat way more food (especially carbs), and increased<a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2015\/01\/29\/7-ways-permanently-banish-belly-fat\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <span class=\"s2\">belly fat<\/span><\/a> is the inevitable result. Because they confuse and slow down your metabolism, you burn fewer calories every day. Artificial sweeteners make you hungrier and cause you to crave even more sugar and starchy carbs, such as bread and pasta.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Artificial sweeteners are highly addictive.<\/b> I regularly see patients who complain they can\u2019t kick their<a href=\"https:\/\/drhyman.com\/blog\/2013\/02\/15\/how-diet-soda-makes-you-fat-and-other-food-and-diet-industry-secrets\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <span class=\"s2\">diet-soda habit<\/span><\/a>. \u201cI have one in the morning and I can\u2019t stop,\u201d they say. It isn\u2019t just their imagination: Artificial sweeteners can quickly become addictive. In an alarming study, rats offered the choice of cocaine or artificial sweeteners<a href=\"http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.0000698\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <span class=\"s2\">always picked the artificial sweetener<\/span><\/a>, even if the rats were previously programmed to be cocaine addicts. The author of the study said that, \u201cThe absolute preference for taste sweetness may lead to a re-ordering in the hierarchy of potentially addictive stimuli, with sweetened diets\u2026 taking precedence over cocaine and possibly other drugs of abuse.\u201d<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Let\u2019s consider that last point a little more closely, particularly with diet sodas, which account for a fair amount of the artificial sweeteners we consume. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One of the biggest struggles I see with patients \u2013 ironically, usually overweight or obese patients \u2013 is surrendering their diet sodas. Like artificial sweeteners, we\u2019ve been misled to think they\u2019re guilt-free alternatives to regular soda.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Hardly. Diet soda and diet drinks make you fat and cause type 2 diabetes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Wait\u2026 diet soda makes people fat? Really? How does that happen?<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If losing weight were all about the calories, then consuming diet drinks would seem like a good idea. That\u2019s certainly what big-name cola companies want us to believe, judging by the ad campaigns highlighting their efforts to fight obesity. (And the other food giants making diet drinks push the same propaganda.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Soda companies proudly promote the fact that it has 180 low- or no-calorie drinks and that it has cut sales of sugared drinks in schools by 90 percent. Is that a good thing? I don\u2019t think so. In fact, it may be worse to drink diet soda than a regular soda.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A 14-year study of 66,118 women published in the <i>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition<\/i> (and supported by many previous and subsequent studies)<a href=\"http:\/\/ajcn.nutrition.org\/content\/early\/2013\/01\/30\/ajcn.112.050997.abstract\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <span class=\"s2\">discovered some frightening facts<\/span><\/a> that should make us all swear off diet drinks and products:<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Diet sodas raised the risk of diabetes more than sugar-sweetened sodas.<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Women who drank one 12-ounce diet soda a week had a 33 percent increased risk of type 2 diabetes, and women who drank one 20-ounce soda a week had a 66 percent increased risk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Women who drank diet sodas drank twice as much as those who drank sugar-sweetened sodas <\/b>because artificial sweeteners are more addictive than regular sugar.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0 <\/span>The average diet soda drinker consumes three diet drinks a day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The bottom line is you can\u2019t outsmart Mother Nature. Fooling your brain into thinking you are getting something sweet plays dirty tricks on your metabolism. Artificial sweeteners disrupt the normal hormonal and neurological signals that control hunger and satiety (feeling full).<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The use of artificial sweeteners, as well as \u201cfood porn,\u201d the sexy experience of sweet, fat, and salt in your mouth,<a href=\"http:\/\/jama.jamanetwork.com\/article.aspx?articleid=185010\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <span class=\"s2\">alters your food preferences<\/span><\/a>. Your palate shifts from being able to enjoy fruits and vegetables and whole foods to liking only the sexy stuff. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Sugar or Artificial Sweeteners: What\u2019s the Answer?<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Let\u2019s be clear here that I am <i>not <\/i>letting sugar off the hook. Of the more than 600,000 food products \u2013 note I said food <i>products<\/i>, not foods \u2013 80 percent have added sugar. That\u2019s where the trouble begins.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We went from eating about 10 pounds of sugar per person, per year in 1800 to 152 pounds of sugar (and 146 pounds of flour) per person, per year today. Think about it: On average we eat about one pound of sugar every day!<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Those sugar-laden foods literally become drugs: Pharmacological doses that hijack our metabolism and make us fat and sick.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Adding a teaspoon of sugar to your coffee or having an occasional dessert doesn\u2019t make you fat and sick. Added sugars in even so-called healthy foods or non-sweet tasting foods creates the real, cumulative damage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I realize this can all become confusing. Here are five ways I recommend making sense about sweeteners:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Have a little. <\/b>If you like sugar and want a little bit, fine, but eat real food and then have sweet things. Consider sugar a recreational drug that you can partake of in moderation like red wine or tequila. Put a little sugar in your coffee because at least you\u2019re aware about how much you\u2019re getting. Likewise, you\u2019re not going to overeat cake, because you know it\u2019s bad for you. One caveat: If you know a little sugar will become a slippery slope for overeating, stay away from the sweet stuff period.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Become aware of hidden sugars even in so-called healthy foods. <\/b>Read ingredients and realize sugar lurks even in foods that don\u2019t taste sweet or that are positioned as healthy.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Learn to appreciate natural sweetness.<\/b> Fruit, nuts, and other real foods contain natural sweetness without processed foods\u2019 sugar overload or the detrimental effects of artificial sweeteners. <\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Stop confusing your body.<\/b> If you have a desire for something sweet have a little sugar, but stay away from \u201cfake\u201d foods. Eating a whole-foods diet that has a low-glycemic load and is rich in phytonutrients and indulging in a few real sweet treats once in a while is a better alternative than tricking your body with artificial sweeteners, which leads to wide scale metabolic rebellion and obesity.<\/span><\/li>\n<li class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Judiciously use this one sweetener. <\/b>Among sweeteners, I make one exception with stevia. A little bit in your coffee or tea should be fine, but be judicious. Besides, overdoing stevia creates a bitter effect, so you\u2019re more likely not to get carried away. If you partake, make sure you\u2019re buying 100 percent pure organic stevia, not the stuff that contains bulking agents like maltodextrin (corn) and nebulous natural flavors.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you really want to break free from the addictive grip of artificial sweeteners and sugar, as well as food sensitivities, I highly recommend doing<a href=\"https:\/\/store.drhyman.com\/Store\/Show\/SearchResults\/1061\/10-Day-Detox-Diet-(Hardcover-Book)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <span class=\"s2\"><i>The Blood Sugar Solution 10-Day Detox Diet<\/i><\/span><\/a>. I&#8217;ve witnessed patients curb their worst sugar and artificial sweetener cravings and learn to appreciate the natural sweetness of real, whole foods in just 10 days.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Whatever you do, stay away from artificial sweeteners. I recommend giving up aspartame, sucralose, sugar alcohols such as xylitol and maltitol, and all of the other heavily used and marketed sweeteners unless you want to slow down your metabolism, gain weight, and become an addict. Use a little stevia if you must, but skip out on the others.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Have you ever considered artificial sweeteners a \u201cfree ride\u201d or over-consumed diet sodas because you believe they\u2019re guilt free?
