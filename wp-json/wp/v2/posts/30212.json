Being vulnerable and open to reality, rather than focusing on the stories we tell ourselves, is a major step in the right direction.<\/p>\n<p>My guest on this week\u2019s episode of <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/the-doctors-farmacy-with-mark-hyman-m-d\/id1382804627?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>The Doctor\u2019s Farmacy<\/em><\/a> has done all of that and more. You probably recognize Lisa Lampanelli\u2019s name from the world of comedy, with a career spanning more than 30 years. She has numerous tours, Grammy nominations, and national TV guest appearances and specials under her belt. Lisa made national headlines in 2012 when she lost more than 100 pounds with the help of bariatric surgery. The comedian went on to speak with unflinching honesty about her lifelong food and body-image issues and has since gone from insulter to inspirer. Now, in her 50\u2019s, she\u2019s done a career overhaul and works as a life coach, food and body-image workshop leader, speaker, and storyteller.<\/p>\n<p>I love Lisa\u2019s take on her personal transformation\u2014going from the Queen of Mean to the Queen of Meaning. Her work to get to the root of her emotional eating and unhealthy retail therapy habit helped Lisa realize all the food, shoes, and handbags in the world couldn\u2019t provide the peace she was searching for. Weight and possessions were showing up as a lack of joy.<\/p>\n<p>Throughout <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/the-doctors-farmacy-with-mark-hyman-m-d\/id1382804627?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">our conversation<\/a>, you\u2019ll be inspired by Lisa\u2019s real and open approach to her life changes. She is the first to tell you she\u2019s not perfect and still struggles from time to time; that makes it even easier to see why each small step we take to help ourselves is a victory. Many of us live in a constant state of low-grade dissatisfaction that we don\u2019t need or deserve. Lisa shares how to take a new perspective, one that says, \u201cI\u2019m worth it,\u201d to begin turning your personal dialogue around.<\/p>\n<p>In this podcast you\u2019ll even get Lisa\u2019s number one tip to embrace your own superpowers: Stop operating out of fear and instead do so out of joy and love. We are never really stuck, there are always ways to flip the script.<\/p>\n<p>I know you\u2019ll be as empowered by this podcast as I am. Lisa\u2019s energy is contagious and, of course, she adds humor to what can be difficult and uncomfortable topics to talk about. I hope you\u2019ll <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/the-doctors-farmacy-with-mark-hyman-m-d\/id1382804627?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tune in<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s never too late to turn your life around.
