A healthy liver means your body stays healthy, you don\u2019t get sick, and you maintain plenty of energy. Unfortunately however, 90 million Americans\u2014and a growing number of individuals worldwide\u2014have what is called fatty liver disease, which literally means your liver fills with fat. This then paves the path for chronic disease and inflammation. But the good news is that fatty liver can be easily treated and reversed with some basic dietary and lifestyle changes.<\/p>\n<p>In this episode, Dr. Hyman speaks with Dr. Elizabeth Boham to discuss how our high-starch and high-sugar diets are largely responsible for driving fatty liver disease, how to know if you have a fatty liver, and how they work with patients to prevent and reverse it.<\/p>\n<p>Elizabeth Boham is a physician and nutritionist who practices Functional Medicine at The UltraWellness Center in Lenox, MA. Through her practice and lecturing she has helped thousands of people achieve their goals of optimum health and wellness. She witnesses the power of nutrition every day in her practice and is committed to training other physicians to utilize nutrition in healing. Dr. Boham has contributed to many articles and wrote the latest chapter on Obesity for the Rankel Textbook of Family Medicine. She is part of the faculty of the Institute for Functional Medicine and has been featured on the Dr. Oz show and in a variety of publications and media including Huffington Post, The Chalkboard Magazine, and Experience Life. Her DVD Breast Wellness: Tools to Prevent and Heal from Breast Cancer explores the Functional Medicine approach to keeping your breasts and whole body well.<\/p>\n<p>This episode is sponsored by Rupa Health and Athletic Greens.<\/p>\n<p>Rupa Health is a place for Functional Medicine practitioners to access more than 2,000 specialty lab tests from over 20 labs like DUTCH, Vibrant America, Genova, Great Plains, and more.
