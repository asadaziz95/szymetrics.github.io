Unfortunately, these workers have historically been marginalized and are often unprotected and underpaid.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this minisode, Dr. Hyman offers a brief overview of why food and farmworkers were not included in the United States Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. He also talks to Kerry Kennedy about a group of farmworkers who banded together to create the Coalition of Immokalee Workers to fight for better wages and working conditions. This coalition of farmworkers found a creative solution to injustice by creating the Fair Food Program, which mandates that growers provide basic protections for their workers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kerry Kennedy is the president of Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights. Since 1981, she has worked on diverse human rights issues including child labor, disappearances, indigenous land rights, judicial independence, freedom of expression, ethnic violence, impunity, women&#8217;s rights, and the environment. Kerry is the author of the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York Times<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> bestsellers <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being Catholic Now<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Robert F.

Kerry founded RFK Compass, which convenes biannual meetings of institutional investors who collectively control $5 to $7 trillion in assets to address the impact of human rights violations on investment outcomes. She serves on the boards of the U.S. Institute of Peace, Human Rights First, Ethics in Action, SDG USA, Sustainable Development Goals Center for Africa, Health eVillages, Kailash Satyarthi Children&#8217;s Foundation, Nizami Ganjavi International Center as well as several public companies.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This episode is brought to you by Belcampo.
